    "Query: What are the fat-soluble vitamins?\n",
    "Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n",

    "Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n",
    "Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",

Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke.

      "- An overall picture of the customerâ€™s standard system will finally turn out by including further requirements made by other plants. Such additional functions can be integrated in a roll-out version of the software product. During the roll-out phase a proven, familiar system is available to the customer, which can also be transferred to other sites with only little effort (saving up to 50 %).â€¢ Integration of all key users The best system will not be accepted if the users do not get the opportunity to get familiar with the system before it is actually implemented. Unless key users get the necessary experience in handling the new system and an understanding of the objectives to be achieved by installing this system, the management will run the risk of loosing the usersâ€™ support. The implementation would inevitably be doomed to failure. For this reason, the key users should be integrated at a very early stage, for instance when defining the system requirements or when analyzing the functionalities. As soon as the pilot system is available, training courses should be held. In this phase, key users are just the right persons to make crucial contributions to improving the system or supported workflows. It is important to win the key users and make them advocates of \"their\" system.\n",
      "- 99 decision is made by management. The MES must consider where in the schedule the new heat order can fit to maintain a continuous caster while using available resources, and minimizing the cost of transition steel. The shortest makespan should also be considered in this optimization problem, since adding a new heat to the schedule means adding more time to process for the day schedule. It is also recommended that quality disturbance handling be incorporated into the A433 Manage Heat Process module and A434 Manage Heat Quality. The A433 module provides the status at failure using the A6 moduleâ€™s Decode Decision Parameters Algorithm; however the A434 module needs an algorithm for QA Process Adjustments. Quality disturbances occur when chemical problems arise mainly from not meeting the correct specification. This could be anything from too much carbon in the steel to the presence of an impurity such as copper. This information is provided when the lab QA system has tested the steel, usually some time before entering the casting stage.â€œTherefore, the immediate response is to keep running but adjust the operating parameters. There are a number of well defined and documented actions that can be taken.\n",
      "- Optimizing the pharmaceutical supply chain by means of MES page 21 of 28 5 Regulatory Requirements Depending on the country the products are delivered to, an MES system for the pharmaceutical industry must functionally comply with the requirements of regulatory authorities in Europe and/or in the United States: â€¢ GMP requirements of FDA (21 CFR Part 210/211) [8]  â€¢ FDA requirements (21 CFR Part 11) for electronic records, electronic signatures [9] These regulations for instance define the procedure for identifying a container (21 CFR Part 211.80 and 105) or the requirements electronic signatures have to meet (21 CFR Part 11.100- 300). Beyond this, there are a number of requirements and guidelines by regulatory authorities stating the QA procedures relating to the Software Development Life Cycle in order to guarantee software products of high quality. Examples are: â€¢ GMP guidelines of EU [10] [11] â€¢ GAMP 4 guidelines [12] European and US laws may vary in details; what they have in common is the requirement for the validation of computerized systems. The fundamental prerequisite that qualifies any system for validation is that clearly defined QA policies have been observed throughout all project phases. In this context, the GAMP V-model has become generally accepted in the pharmaceutical industry. The V-model divides the production and maintenance of software systems into the phases Design Qualification, Development Implementation, Factory and Site Acceptance Test, Installation Qualification (IQ), Operational Qualification (OQ), Performance Qualification (PQ), and Ongoing Qualification. All these phases have to be concluded with a verification to prove that all the requirements for the respective phase have been fulfilled. All the verifications have to be performed in a formal and systematic way. Change management procedures have to be established to ensure an overall consistency of the entire documentation across all phases. The computer system must be developed and tested in accordance with a quality management system.\n",

       "'Supply chain refers to the network of organizations, people, and activities involved in the production and delivery of a product or service. It encompasses the flow of goods, services, and information from raw materials to end customers. In the context of Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), supply chain management involves the planning, coordination, and execution of activities related to the production and delivery of products, including inventory management, logistics, and transportation. MES solutions support supply chain management by providing real-time visibility into production processes, enabling data-driven decision-making, and automating tasks such as order management, inventory tracking, and material management. By optimizing supply chain operations, MES solutions can help manufacturers improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance'"
