       "  'text': \"What is MES? MES stands for Manufacturing Execution System, meaning a control system for monitoring and managing work and process on the factory floor. But that's an oversimplification of what a successful MES software implementation can do for manufacturers. MES provides detailed resource scheduling and status, production, dispatch, and sequencing. Traceability, genealogy, inventory, quality assurance, maintenance, management, document control, performance, analysis, and more. MES is crucial for manufacturers because it exists in a space between business-oriented applications like ERP and SCADA HMI systems designed to directly control plant-floor operations. While an ERP can help allocate resources, it lacks the level of detail that MES provides. MES allows for real time, minute to minute, or quicker resource scheduling, as well as handling execution and dispatch. MES connects production to executive decision making by controlling, tracking, and documenting the transformation of raw materials into finished goods in real time. This information gives a current, accurate view of plant-floor operations, especially when combined with dashboards that display current statuses and rates, which can be compared to both historical data as well as scheduled production goals. Similarly, MES assists with recipe management, allowing organizations to formulate consistent methods for creating products from batch to batch, reducing waste while streamlining processes. Additionally, recipes can be easily updated and altered, quickly adding new products or adjusting the spec of current offerings. MES manages work in progress or WIP inventory throughout various stages of production. By integrating with ERP and SCATES systems, MES automatically validates inventory levels at each stage, eliminating the need for manual verification. Related to WIP inventory is the concept of track and trace, which documents batches and individual products on their journey from raw materials to semi-finished goods, and finally to finish products. By tracking, organizations gain a complete picture of each unit and can instantly trace its path through production in the case of a quality fluctuation. All production facilities will have variations, deviations, and exceptions in terms of quality and accepted parameters, connecting MES to a more granular skater system allows operators to see alarms that indicate in real time when units are out of spec. While not technically part of the system itself, overall equipment effectiveness or OEE is closely linked to MES. OEE considers three ratios. Actual runtime to plan production time. The number of units started to the number of units processed at the standard rate, and good units produced to units started. Using these ratios, organizations can analyze their operations, gain valuable insight, then improve production and equipment throughput. A large factor in OEE is downtime tracking. Every minute of downtime on the plant floor means losing money and puts production behind schedule. Reducing or even eliminating downtime is vital to meeting production goals and becoming a more efficient organization. One of the best ways to implement an MES solution is to use the ignition software The Ignition acts as the base, with built-in tools to develop best-in-class SCADA, HMI, solutions, where they serve as centric architecture paired with an unlimited licensing model. Ignition brings cutting edge automation software to both the plant floor and the boardroom. A versatile solution like the ignition perspective module can easily connect data sources from across the organization, displaying that information on flexible dynamic dashboards and generating custom reports all in a mobile responsive application. Sepsoft's module slot right into ignition, expediting MES development while delivering a powerful feature set including batch processing, downtime monitoring, procedure management, and more. MES can be complicated and creating a custom solution from scratch can be difficult to build and even harder to maintain. Alternatively, SubstanceASOS' low-code solutions reduce development time, minimizing technical debt and total cost of ownership. In one way or another, all organizations have a manufacturing execution system, whether it's automated, manual, or tracked completely in the mind of one person. But in a plant-floor environment where consistency is vital and downtime can be catastrophic, Implementing a true MES will not only improve efficiency, it will help manufacturers become stronger businesses. you\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I've really been enjoying this new addition to my configuration which is oil and them before I was using LIR, which I really liked, but oil has been awesome to be able to really easily edit and change the file system directly inside of NeoVem without having to do a bunch of crazy stuff and I've actually run into a few situations already where I've used oil to change a whole directory of files really easily just by doing like three different VIM commands instead of writing a really complicated script to change all of the file names and then mess it up somehow and delete all my files and lose them. So oil is really cool. Oil is effectively, it's not a file tree, it's like a directory viewer. Okay. And what it does that I think is really good, although I'm sure you can use it for some file tree things. I generally do not have oil open all the time. Okay, I'm not a file tree and joyer. As we've talked about a few other times, I think generally it's sort of just taking up space in your thing, although it's okay to use sort of to explore a particular section maybe. But oil is about just editing or viewing a particular directory and sort of navigating within that. So one thing that I like about oil as well is it has really great defaults. It makes it super easy to get started. You see, I barely have any config here. Most of it is just setting up two keybinds that I personally like and turning off a keybind because I use Control H, J, K, L to navigate. And so I wanted those turned off sort of inside of oil. So what does it actually do? That's enough talking about what it is, right? I'll press minus. That's this key bind here, which says run oil. When I press minus, what it does is it opens up sort of the parent directory of whatever file I was working on. I was just inside of this oil file, press minus, and then it opens up this directory. What's cool is if I change this to oil example, and then I save this buffer. Okay, so I've just made the change and I'm gonna save the buffer, press enter and says, hey, would you like to move this? I say, yes, yes, I would. Thank you. And so now when I open this, you'll see, hey, I've got that file that we had before. If I pop back out again and I just delete to the dots, right, dt dot, then I can say the file and say, do you want to move it? Yes, I do. And so what I like about this is I can sort of do the text manipulation tasks that I generally do anyways while I'm editing and I can apply those really quickly to different files. You can also do something like sub folder and if it has a slash at the end when you save it, I'll say hey, I'm gonna create a sub folder you bet I do and then I'll create the sub folder where're centered to go in nested.lua. I can save this, say yes. It saves it. I open it and I'm in plugins, subfolder, and there we go. You can see nested, right? And then if I hop back out and I delete this line and I say, it says, you sure you want to delete that? And I say, as I sure do, because this is just an example and I'm doing it for all of you. So that's sort of the main thing with oil that I really like. I know some people really enjoy sort of the the floating one I haven't really gotten the floating one in my workflow yet. Mostly because whenever I do something like this, I'd sort of rather it just take up the whole screen for me or whatever split I'm in so I can make sure I'm tracking with the particular split but I could maybe see some examples where I'd want to do that or maybe I'd want to pop it up on the side or something I haven't explored sort of the floating configuration options that it has, but I really, really, really like this idea here of just being able to press dash. And if I wanted to add to all of these files example here in front of them. I can just write this and it'll say, hey, I'm gonna put example in front of all those. And this is actually gonna say no, I don't want to do that. And I'll just reread the file back in by doing edit with a bang to make sure that I sort of grab back what the original contents were. And that's basically everything oil does, or at least that I'm using it for so far. If you've got something that you're using oil for that I'm not that you're like this is my favorite feature of oil which I've already sort of found a few, you know, like making the buffers. It also has stuff like preview, which is kind of fun, so you can preview the file before you and those are really helpful as well. I don't find them as helpful as some of the other ones because if I know the file that I want to look at, I usually just will type it in and then press Ctrl V or something like this inside of Telescope to just open up that file separately. I do really like it for a few of these things and for maybe hopping around within the current folder occasionally, but otherwise I usually then navigate back via telescope or via some sort of LSP navigation. So anyways, hope you like this one. This has been probably is definitely one of my top favorite additions in the Nuke and Fig. And yeah, thanks everybody. I'll see you later.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"The question is what is MES? Okay, and for those of you who know what MES is, I encourage you to watch this video either if you're really advanced MES developer this should resonate if you've just dabbled, this is going to be really helpful. So, MES is manufacturing execution system. Okay, that's what it is. Or it may be called, you may see it referred to as mom or MES, but manufacturing execution system is what MES is. Here's the problem with MES. If I say SCATUS system, SCATUS system A, SC skated system B, skated system C, they're always identical, they're all the same thing, they're always supervisory control and data acquisition. You acquire data, you visualize data, you control processes, you monitor processes, you can configure alarms, you react to alarms, etc. That is skater. It's always skater. Functionality is always the same. One of the things that we run into and in the types of projects we do is somebody will say to us, we want MES, right? I want MES. Well, the thing is, MES is not a thing. It's many things. So a manufacturing execution system system before I explain what it is. Let's talk about where it fits, right? So, you know, you guys have seen this before, right? We sell stuff, we play into manufacturer stuff, we execute the manufacturing of it, we inventory it, we ship it, we get paid for it, we do it all over again. That's every manufacturer. If we look at the automation stack, right, we have cloud, we have ERP, we have the MES layer here, we have SCADA, and we have PLCHMI, right? The famous automation stack, okay? If we were going to build this out. If we were going to make this visualization representative, this MES box would be the size of the entire stack. Okay, in MES there's basically four core capabilities in pretty much every MES system. We call this the core four. So number one, you have work orders, okay? I take something that I plan to manufacture and I turn it into a work order. That work order translates into a production run, okay, that out of an asset. Second thing is scheduling, okay, I schedule work orders to be run, okay, the third thing this is the most common is OEE, overall equipment effectiveness. That is how efficient are each of my assets, how efficient are my areas. It helps me understand how we're running. I use OEE if you guys want to know more about what OEE is, check the video up here, over there down here, wherever's that, as I'd split it. But I go in depth explaining what is OEE and why you have to calculate it. And then the last thing is downtime tracking, okay, that's your core 4 so when someone says generically MES what they're really talking about is or they should be talking about work order management scheduling work orders tracking OEE and tracking our downtime. OEE is AQP, right? Availability quality performance and it helps us narrow down why is it we're not producing what we want to produce. Okay, so at a high level that's MES. The problem is when someone says I want MES, when someone says I want skada, five different people say they want skada, they're all asking for the exact same thing. But when you get five different people who are asking you what an MES system, they're not talking about the same thing. Here's a list of what's go ahead and put our core four, which you generally have in basically every MES system. Okay. Those are going to be in generally every system. Important note, come on, let me fix this. Important note, scheduling is the first one to get dropped off of this. Okay? So if there's any feature I'm not going to have in the core 4. It's going to be scheduling. Because there are many times where scheduling is handled in the ERP system and all you're doing is consuming the schedule from the ERP. The second thing that would get dropped off are the work orders. My work orders may be manufacturing orders that come from my routing inside the ERP so I may not have core 4 in the MES proper, okay? You are never going to drop these two. You're always going to calculate OEE. You are always going to track down time. But you also might add, and I'm just going to list off the top of my head the other capabilities that I know of okay, so let's start with recipe management, Okay, let's go to DQIP, digital quality inspection plans. We could do a sample collection for quality. We could do SPC statistical process control. We could do SPA. We could do SPA, we could do ISO 9001 compliance, we could do digital work instructions while recipe management could be this could be definition this could be spec and this could be deviation tracking okay, inventory consuming. I'm gonna get to that for so the next thing is so from bomb to Inventory management So that is consuming, consuming whip and raw material, creating whip and finish goods this you could also have kidding involved in this those are just some of the addition. I mean, there's like a hundred other capabilities. Okay. So what is MES? MES at its core is the system in the middle of your business that takes a plan, something you sold that you plan to manufacture and it helps you execute the manufacturing of that thing. Okay, that's what MES is. The problem is that MES isn't a product. MES is not just one set of solutions or capabilities. It is what you're doing is you've got this big bucket of capabilities and you're picking the ones that you need for your business. What I listed here was just the stuff I did off the top of my head in the space I have on the board here. The reality is is that when someone says MES, you are always going to have OEE and downtime tracking you're always gonna have dashboards and you may have nothing else and then you're almost certainly going to add all these features. Building an MES or some of these features. I may go, you know, recipe management is a really, really critical component of our business. We want to go ahead and transform our quality inspection plans, which are basically paper driven with operator standing at the end of the line doing visual inspection and some measurements to we want to move that digital quality triggered off of certain values that we see coming off the production line, right, or some event that happens. Digital work instructions, well, document management. So there's another one that we're messing. I mean, there are many, many capabilities of MES. When you build MES, you generally start here and then start picking from this library of other capabilities. What you need to understand walking away from this is this. MES is a system that grows with the business and that MES at customer A never ever ever ever equals MES at customer B. Whileatea a customer A is generally identical to Skatea customer B.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"If you're a manufacturer trying to automate your operations, it'd become more efficient and to increase throughput and productivity, manufacturing execution systems or MES software is a critical component of any digital transformation in a manufacturing environment. So what I want to do today is talk about the top 10 manufacturing execution systems in the marketplace today. My name is Eric Kimberling. I'm the CEO of Third Stage Consulting. We're an independent consulting firm that helps clients throughout the world with their digital transformation journeys. And a core component of most manufacturing digital strategies in the 2020s is MES software, manufacturing executions software. And what MES software does is essentially automate shop floor operations. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail of describing what MES is if you'd like to know more fundamentally what MES is I actually have a video on my YouTube channel called what is MES software that'll give you a little bit more background. So what I want to focus on today or what are the top 10 MES systems that you should be thinking about or considering is you define your digital strategy for your manufacturing organizations. And this is an independent ranking that was not done in conjunction with any sort of software and 100% technology agnostic and independent. So this is meant to be a very objective ranking based on a number of criteria, including the general capabilities within a manufacturing environment, the value for the money, the ROI that organizations typically realize realize as well as the adoption rate among other manufacturers in the space. So without further ado, let's dive into our top 10 list. Coming in at number 10 is E2 Shop System. And E2 is a standalone shop floor manufacturing execution system. And the reason I point this out is because some of the other systems in our top 10 list are systems that do other things in addition to MES, but E2 focuses exclusively on shop floor automation. Now some of the advantages of E2 include the fact that it can handle make to order complex manufacturing environments. So if you're an organization that isn't selling vanilla high volume types of products but instead you're selling custom lower volume types of products, e2 can be a great fit for you. In addition, the product is relatively simple to use when we compare it to other systems in the marketplace. And E2, given that it's a smaller software vendor, tends to have better customer service and it tends to give their customers a little bit more attention than what we see with some of the other bigger vendors in our top 10 list. Now just like every other system we're going to talk about here on the top 10 list, E2 also has weaknesses in addition to strengths. First and foremost, it's a product that can be expensive over time. The cost of the product can be a bit higher than some of the others in our top 10 list. The reporting isn't as strong as some of the other systems in our top 10 list and the general breadth of capability is as strong as some of the others in our top 10 lists. But if you're a make to order or engineer order manufacturer, e2 might be a good solution to consider. Coming in at number nine is SAP ME. ME stands for Manufacturing Execution and SAP is a broader enterprise-wide technology. So SAPME is one module or one system within the SAP suite of products. So if you're a manufacturer that's looking not only to manufacturing but also looking at other parts of your operations like warehouse management, financial management, inventory management, CRM, etc. SAP ME might be a good one to consider. Some of the strengths of MEP include the fact that it can support highly scalable environments, so larger or more complex manufacturing environments. It also is very good at providing detailed production visibility into operations as well as reporting and analytics. Those are some of the strengths of the SAP MED system. Now some of the downside weaknesses of the product include the fact that there can be a steep learning curve for learning the product. It's not as easy to use and not as easy to learn as some of the other products in the marketplace. Not to be fair, that's because it is a very powerful tool, which comes along with a certain amount of complexity and a certain learning curve. The data archiving and data management can be more complex and difficult, but again, it's because it requires so much in the form of data in order to handle the complex capabilities that it offers. And finally, it's a product that's not ideal for smaller mid-sized businesses. It's generally going to fit better for larger, more complex organizations if you're a smaller mid-size organization or if you just don't have that complex of a manufacturing environment, SAPME may be overkill for you and may actually end up costing you a lot more than it does deliver business benefits. But having said all that, that's enough to land SAP ME at number nine on our list. Coming in, number eight is fish bowl manufacturing and fish bowl is a product that specializes more for small and mid-size manufacturing shops. So if you're a smaller manufacturer, you don't have super complex needs, you don't need all the complexities and all the robust capabilities of,, which we just talked about, then fishbowl might be a good option for you. Now the biggest upside for fishbowl are to use. It's not as complex, it's not as hard to learn as some of the other systems in the marketplace. And as I mentioned before, it's also tailored and targeted to small and mid-sized manufacturers. So if you fit that profile, this bowl could be a great fit for you. Now some of the downside risk of fish bowl include the fact that it's not built for larger organizations. So if you are a larger organization or more complex manufacturer, you're probably going to outgrow the needs that fish bowl pretty quickly. Some of the reporting and analytics are weak compared to other reporting and analytic capabilities of some of the other systems in the marketplace. And finally, the product is not an all-inclusive system. So if you are looking for a system that can do more than just the shop floor management and the manufacturing execution, then you may want to look to one of the other systems in our top 10 lists that are more broader enterprise wide technologies that can also integrate to financials and other parts of your business. But having said all of that, that's enough to land fish bowl number eight on our list. Coming in at number seven is manufacturing D365, which is often used by manufacturers to automate their shop floors. Now some of the benefits are the strengths of D365 include the fact that it's a Microsoft product, so it has that Microsoft look and feel that many of us are used to, and that can make learning and adoption a bit easier in many cases. It's also a pretty robust product, so it's a good balance between some of the smaller vendors in our top 10 list that cater to small and mid-size organizations, which Microsoft D365 can do, but it also is scalable, so it's something that can grow with your organization. And if you are a larger, more complex manufacturer, D365 can typically scale for that sizing complexity. And then finally, the other big strength of Microsoft Dynamics 365 is the fact that it's easy to configure, customize, and integrate. It's a pretty open platform. It has that Microsoft flexibility that a lot of us are used to and so that can be a strength of the product as well, especially if you have unique needs and you know you're going to need to tailor the software to fit your needs. Now the downside risk of D365 is because it is a broad big system that does more than just manufacturing execution, it creates a lot of complexities that can take time to implement. The setup and the learning curve can be a bit difficult, at least just in terms of establishing and implementing the software. And finally, the cost can be a bit higher than some of the other products that we considered in our top 10 list. So all of these things considered are enough to land Microsoft Dynamics 365 and number seven on our list. Coming in at number six is Oracle Netsuite. In Oracle Netsuite isn't well known in the manufacturing space and it's not considered a really strong manufacturing system, but for more vanilla higher volume lower complexities sorts of manufacturing environments next week can be a great option. Especially if you're a small to mid-size organization that's looking to implement an enterprise-wide technology, Nets we can be a great option because it does everything that an enterprise needs from financials, to inventory management, to warehouse management, to other functions, including manufacturing. Now some of the benefits of Netsuite include the fact that it's a SaaS or a cloud-based system that allows you to deploy the technology a bit faster, although learning the technology and actually deploying it into your business takes a bit longer. But the technical implementation and setup itself can be a bit faster than some of the other systems in our top 10 list. It's also a product that integrates with other systems fairly easily. So if you do need to tie into any legacy or regulatory-based systems, then that's we can be a good option. Now the downside of a net suite is that it can include some costs that creep up on you over time. So the recurring subscription costs and all the escalators and kickers that kick in over time is the company grows and as you increase transaction volumes, that can actually increase and escalate fairly quickly or more quickly than you might be comfortable with. So that's something to fully understand is what is your total cost of ownership in the long term for using a product like NetSuite. Another downside is that NetSuite is known in notorious for difficult implementations in that they typically don't provide very hands on or robust implementation capabilities from net suite themselves. Now having said that, there are third party partners and help mitigate that risk. And then finally, probably the biggest risk of net speed or the biggest weakness is that if you are a complex manufacturer or if you anticipate growing and scaling to become a more complex manufacturer, that's a sweet system that you're more likely to outgrow than some of the other systems in our top 10 list. But having said all of this, and especially if we factor in the adoption rate of Netsuite, which is very high for small, admit size organizations, this is enough for Netsuite to land number six on our list. I mean, number five on our list is aption. And aption is a software vendor that's actually grown up through the acquisition of several different manufacturing based ERP systems and manufacturing is their core area of focus. They don't do a whole lot outside of manufacturing. One of the strongest areas of their focus is food and beverage manufacturing. So if you're a food and beverage manufacturer, apti might actually be higher on your list, but in general, if you're any sort of manufacturer apti and might be one you consider. Now part of the strength or one of the strengths of the product is A that you have an exclusive focus on manufacturing so the software is built for It's also user friendly and highly customizable compared to other systems in our top 10 list. And finally, it's a full-blown ERP system, so aption doesn't just do manufacturing execution, it also does financials, inventory management. and complete solution that does not just manufacturing but also integrates to other sorts of business processes apti and might be worth considering. So along with the strengths come a couple of weaknesses of aption and one is that the product is harder to configure and set up when compared to other systems in the marketplace, or at least that's the feedback we get from some of our clients. And when compared to other software vendors in the frequency of updates to the software, apti intends to be a little slower than some of the other products when it comes to R&D and getting upgrades and updates out to their customers. So that's something to consider as well, especially if you're the type of organization that wants to be on the latest and greatest in terms of advancements and R&D dollars being invested in new technologies. But having said all of that, that's enough to land aption in number five on our list. Coming in at number four is in four. If you haven't heard of in four, they're actually one of the largest software why they've rated so highly in our top 10 list. Now some of the benefits of in-forz MES capabilities include the fact that it's relatively easy to learn has a relatively easy user interface to learn and understand. It's fairly customizable, more customizable than many of the systems in our top 10 list. And there's constant improvements and updates to the technologies. So it's a vendor that tends to push out improvements and updates and invest very heavily in manufacturing R&D, which can be a benefit to you if you're one of their customers. And finally, in-four is a full-blown ERP system. So if you're looking for capabilities outside of manufacturing, inform might be a good consideration. Now some of the weaknesses of the product include the fact that if you have multiple locations and multiple shop floors and manufacturing facilities, it can be somewhat limited in stability to handle a breadth of different processes and functions. So it's not exactly suitable for multiple locations or as suitable as some of the other systems in our top 10 list. The yearly licensing is known to be somewhat cumbersome and costly, although that pricing model is evolving as they migrate more to Infore Cloud Suite, which is more of a cloud-based subscription-based model, but the pricing is a bit confusing to some of our customers. And finally, the overall cost of info can be a bit higher than some of the other systems in our top 10 list. But having said all of that is enough to land N4 a number four on our list. Coming in at number three is Epicor Advanced MES. And if you haven't heard of Epicor, Epicor is another software vendor that focuses very heavily on the manufacturing space. So, MES is one of the capabilities that they've really doubled down on over the years. Now, some of the benefits of using Epicor in addition to the fact that it's focused on manufacturing is first of all it's a product that's relatively easy to use. The user interface is easy to learn and pick up when you compare it to other systems in our list. The product is also highly customizable and there's a lot of add-ons available to give you the capabilities you might need that aren't necessarily inherent in the core product. And finally, they give you more deployment options than a lot of other software vendors in our top 10 lists. So in other words, you can deploy the software on premise or in the cloud, which a lot of organizations like to have that choice or that flexibility or at the very least to know that they can switch back and forth depending on what their needs are in the future. Now some of the downside weaknesses of Epicore include first of all the fact that it can be hard to find some of the more advanced features. So while in one hand it is a system that's easier to use and learn, some of the more advanced capabilities are a bit harder to figure out. So really making sure that you train your people and that they fully understand the capabilities of the software is even more important for Epicoir than other types of systems. In addition, the reporting tends to take some time to set up and the system itself tends to be a bit slower in terms of performance than other systems in the marketplace. So all that being said, that's enough to land at the core advanced MES at number three on there list. Coming in at number two is IQMS and IQMS is a software vendor that has a very large manufacturing install base. In fact, most of our clients that choose IQMS are in the manufacturing space. So some of the unique strengths of the product include the fact that it is very scalable. So if you're a high growth, smaller mid-size manufacturer and you anticipate being a large one in the future, you at least anticipate some high levels of growth. IQ and MS can be a good one. It can be simple enough to start out when you're smaller, but can also scale up for as you grow and as you become more complex and your needs evolve over time. The product also has very robust real-time monitoring features, so it provides better visibility into real time data, which not all the systems can do as well as IQMS. And then of course the third strength that I'll point out is the fact that it does focus on manufacturing. So it is a product that's largely built for manufacturing. Whereas some of the other systems in our top 10 list, yes, they can do manufacturing, but they're also trying to be everything to everyone else at the same time. So it's, in many cases, a strength to know that you've got to vendor this focused on your vertical. Now some of the downside risk of IQMS include the fact that the cost can be a bit higher than some of the other software vendors in our list. The reporting can be somewhat cumbersome and complicated so it's not as intuitive, not as easy to set up as some of the other reporting capabilities of some of the other systems in our list. And it's been known within the community that some customers have trouble with upgrades and updates to the software so they are frequent and sometimes I can cause disruptions to the operations. And that's something we hear a bit more often in this software vendor vertical than in other software vendors in our top 10 list. But having said all that, that's enough to land IQ MS at number two on our list. Coming in at number one is Plex systems and Plex is a product that is built for manufacturing and one of the unique aspects of Plex is the fact that it was built in the cloud about 20 years ago. So while many software vendors and MES providers are just now trying to migrate their old on-premise systems to the cloud. Plex has been in the cloud for quite some time, so they have a head start on that whole cloud migration. So it's a cloud-based solution, it's focused on manufacturing, those are two of the biggest strengths of the product. And some of the other strengths include the fact that it's easy to use. It has a very slick user interface and it's easy for employees to learn. And Plex also has a lower cost than many of the software vendors in our list, which means you can get a better ROI and better value for that investment in their technology. Now even though it's number one, Plex also does have its downside, weaknesses, which are worth noting. First is that even though it's easy to use and it's got a slick interface. Sometimes there are parts of the workflows that aren't as intuitive as others. And so it's a bit inconsistent in its usability and its overall aesthetic appeal of the user interface. It's also been known to be prone to bugs because perhaps they're a smaller vendor. They're not one of the biggest vendors in our list. There's just not as much support and R&D dollars going into fixing those bugs and making sure that the bugs are worked out before it's released but having that, we haven't seen any situations where organizations have been completely shut down or materially disrupted as a result of some of those bugs. And then finally, some of the implementation partner capabilities are a bit limited with Plex when you compare it to some of the other systems in our top 10 list. So if you're looking for third party providers or Vars that can help you implement the solution, your options are a bit more limited. So if you do choose Plex, you want to make sure you really think through and understand what your options are, make sure you have a clear plan and a clear roadmap for how you're going to deploy the technology. But having said all of that, that's enough to land Plexign number one on our list. I hope this is provided you some good information, some things to think about as you evaluate potential MES providers. But for more information, I also wanted to give you some more resources that will help you in your research and in your transformation journey. In particular, I encourage you to download our annual Digital transformation report, which includes a number of different resources, best practices for your digital transformation, as well as top 10 rankings and reviews like this one but also for other functions and capabilities within your organization. So I encourage you to download that, I've included a link below, and I've also included links to other resources I think might benefit you as an organization in your digital transformation journey. So if you found this information useful and hope you have a great day.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'as those that derive more than 30 percent of calories from protein.  Many people follow high-protein diets because marketers tout  protein’s ability to stimulate weight loss. It is true that following  high-protein diets increases weight loss in some people. However  the number of individuals that remain on this type of diet is low  and many people who try the diet and stop regain the weight they  had lost. Additionally, there is a scientific hypothesis that there may  be health consequences of remaining on high-protein diets for the  long-term, but clinical trials are ongoing or scheduled to examine  this hypothesis further. As the high-protein diet trend arose so  did the intensely debated issue of whether there are any health  consequences of eating too much protein. Observational studies  conducted in the general population suggest diets high in animal  protein, specifically those in which the primary protein source is  red meat, are linked to a higher risk for kidney stones, kidney  disease, liver malfunction, colorectal cancer, and osteoporosis.  However, diets that include lots of red meat are also high in  saturated fat and cholesterol and sometimes linked to unhealthy  lifestyles, so it is difficult to conclude that the high protein content  is the culprit.  High protein diets appear to only increase the progression of  kidney disease and liver malfunction in people who already have  kidney or liver malfunction, and not to cause these problems.  However, the prevalence of kidney disorders is relatively high and  underdiagnosed. In regard to colon cancer, an assessment of more  than ten studies performed around the world published in the June  2011 issue of PLoS purports that a high intake of red meat and  processed meat is associated with a significant increase in colon  cancer risk.1Although there are a few ideas, the exact mechanism of  1.\\xa0Chan DS, Lau R, et al.

Why then, does the water not flow from blood  plasma to cells? The force of water also known as hydrostatic  pressure  maintains  the  volumes  of  water  between  fluid  compartments against the force of all dissolved substances. The  concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.  (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between  the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration  of all dissolved substances is equal.)  The force driving the water movement through the selectively  permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the  one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a  selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic  pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared  to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the  water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing  more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the  pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net  water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an  equal rate).  One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different  volumes is the following  5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L =  5g/L)  The differences in concentrations of particular substances  provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.  A concentration gradient is a form of potential energy, like water  172  |  Electrolytes Important for Fluid Balance\",\n          \"Units of Measure  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI\\u2018I AT M\\u0100NOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  In  nutrition,  there  are  two  systems  of  commonly  used  measurements: Metric and US Customary.

For example, dental problems can lead to difficulties  with chewing and swallowing, which in turn can make it hard to  maintain a healthy diet. The use of dentures or the preparation of  pureed or chopped foods can help solve this problem. There also  is a decreased thirst response in the elderly, and the kidneys have  a decreased ability to concentrate urine, both of which can lead to  dehydration.  Sensory Issues  At about age sixty, taste buds begin to decrease in size and number.  As a result, the taste threshold is higher in older adults, meaning  that more of the same flavor must be present to detect the taste.  Many elderly people lose the ability to distinguish between salty,  sour, sweet, and bitter flavors. This can make food seem less  appealing and decrease the appetite. An intake of foods high in  sugar and sodium can increase due to an inability to discern those  tastes. The sense of smell also decreases, which impacts attitudes  toward food. Sensory issues may also affect the digestion because  the taste and smell of food stimulates the secretion of  digestive\\u00a0enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and pancreas.  Dysphagia  Some older adults have difficulty getting adequate nutrition  because of the disorder dysphagia, which impairs the ability to  swallow. Any damage to the parts of the brain that control  swallowing can result in dysphagia, therefore stroke is a common  cause. Dysphagia is also associated with advanced dementia  because of overall brain function impairment. To assist older adults  suffering from dysphagia, it can be helpful to alter food consistency.

Extraction may involve chelation therapy, which binds with lead so it can be excreted in urine. Another treatment protocol, EDTA therapy, involves administering a drug called ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid to remove lead from the bloodstream of patients with levels greater than 45 mcg/dL.9 Fortunately, lead toxicity is highly preventable. It involves identifying potential hazards, such as lead paint and pipes, and removing them before children are exposed to them.

      "Macronutrients Nutrients that are needed in large amounts are called macronutrients. There are three classes of macronutrients: carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work, allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories, denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other macronutrients, it does not yield calories. Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n",
      "Water There is one other nutrient that we must have in large quantities: water. Water does not contain carbon, but is composed of two hydrogens and one oxygen per molecule of water. More than 60 percent of your total body weight is water. Without it, nothing could be transported in or out of the body, chemical reactions would not occur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature would fluctuate widely. On average, an adult consumes just over two liters of water per day from food and drink combined. Since water is so critical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and output is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in Chapter 4. Micronutrients Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser amounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions. Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins. There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See Table 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2 “Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their major functions). In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, micronutrients are not sources of energy (calories), but they assist in the process as cofactors or components of enzymes (i.e., coenzymes).\n",
      "Learning Objectives By the end of this chapter, you will be able to: • Describe basic concepts in nutrition • Describe factors that affect your nutritional needs • Describe the importance of research and scientific methods to understanding nutrition What are Nutrients?The foods we eat contain nutrients. Nutrients are substances required by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not synthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure, and/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and reproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body to function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or beneficial (such as antioxidants).4 | Introduction\n",
      "Vitamins Major Functions Water-soluble Thiamin (B1) Coenzyme, energy metabolism assistance Riboflavin (B2 ) Coenzyme, energy metabolism assistance Niacin (B3) Coenzyme, energy metabolism assistance Pantothenic acid (B5) Coenzyme, energy metabolism assistance Pyridoxine (B6) Coenzyme, amino acid synthesis assistance Biotin (B7) Coenzyme, amino acid and fatty acid metabolism Folate (B9) Coenzyme, essential for growth Cobalamin (B12) Coenzyme, red blood cell synthesis C (ascorbic acid) Collagen synthesis, antioxidant Fat-soluble A Vision, reproduction, immune system function D Bone and teeth health maintenance, immune system function E Antioxidant, cell membrane protection K Bone and teeth health maintenance, blood clotting Vitamin deficiencies can cause severe health problems and even death. For example, a deficiency in niacin causes a disease called pellagra, which was common in the early twentieth century in some parts of America. The common signs and symptoms of pellagra are known as the “4D’s—diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death.”Until scientists found out that better diets relieved the signs and symptoms of pellagra, many people with the disease ended up hospitalized in insane asylums awaiting death. Other vitamins were also found to prevent certain disorders and diseases such as scurvy (vitamin C), night blindness vitamin A, and rickets (vitamin D).

      "Figure 1.1 The Macronutrie nts: Carbohydrat es, Lipids, Protein, and Water Proteins Proteins are macromolecules composed of chains of subunits called amino acids. Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Food sources of proteins include meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant- based foods, most notably soy. The word protein comes from a Greek word meaning “of primary importance,” which is an apt description of these macronutrients; they are also known colloquially as the “workhorses” of life. Proteins provide four kilocalories of energy per gram; however providing energy is not protein’s most important function. Proteins provide structure to bones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most of the chemical reactions that take place in the body. Scientists estimate that greater than one-hundred thousand different proteins exist within the human body. The genetic codes in DNA are basically protein recipes that determine the order in which 20 different amino acids are bound together to make thousands of specific proteins.

    "Query: What are the fat-soluble vitamins?\n",
    "Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n",
    "\\nExample 2:\n",
    "Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n",
    "Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",
    "\\nExample 3:\n",
    "Query: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\n",
    "Answer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after exercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\n",

A newborn infant (birth to 28 days) requires feedings eight to twelve times a day or more. Between 1 and 3 months of age, the breastfed infant becomes more efficient, and the number of feedings per day often become fewer even though the amount of milk consumed stays the same. After about six months, infants can gradually begin to consume solid foods to help meet nutrient needs. Foods that are added in addition to breastmilk are called complementary foods. Complementary foods should be nutrient dense to provide optimal nutrition. Complementary foods include baby meats, vegetables, fruits, infant cereal, and dairy products such as yogurt, but not infant formula. Infant formula is a substitute, not a complement to breastmilk. In addition to complementary foods, the World Health Organization recommends that breastfeeding continue up to 2 years of age or beyond, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends at least one year of breastfeeding, or longer.',\n",

It is normal for a woman to have one breast that is different than the other in size or shape. During pregnancy, the breasts will normally increase in size. If a woman does not notice any changes to her breast during pregnancy, she should discuss this with her healthcare provider or a lactation consultant. After the birth of the baby, nutritional needs must be met to ensure that an infant not only survives, but thrives from infancy into childhood. Breastfeeding provides the fuel a newborn needs for rapid growth and development. As a result, the WHO recommends that breastfeeding is exclusive (no other food or drink) for the first six months of an infant’s life. Exclusive breastfeeding is one of the best ways a mother can support the growth and protect the health of her infant child. Breast milk contains nearly all of the nutrients that a newborn requires and gives a child the best start to a healthy life. Most women want to breastfeed their babies; in the US, over 80% of women start to breastfeed their infants.',\n",

Members of a community can also promote and support breastfeeding. New mothers can join peer counseling groups or turn to other women within their community who have previous experience with breastfeeding. In addition, community-based programs can provide education and support. The US Department of Agriculture’s Women, Infants, and Children program provides information on breastfeeding and both professional and peer support for women and their babies from low-income families.

Most expectant mothers begin thinking about how they will feed their baby early in their pregnancy. Therefore, it is important to offer breastfeeding education and support starting with the first prenatal appointment. Support from family members, especially the baby’s father and grandmother, plus friends, employers, and others can greatly help with both the decision-making process during pregnancy and the beginning and maintenance of breastfeeding after the baby’s birth. In the United States, about 83.2 percent of babies start out being breastfed.1\\xa0Yet by the age of six months, when solid foods should begin to be introduced into a child’s diet along with breast milk, only about 25 percent of infants in the United States were still breastfed exclusively, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).2 The approval and assistance of family members, friends, employers, health-care providers, and policymakers can make an enormous difference and provide the needed promotion and support for mothers who wish to breastfeed their children. Education about breastfeeding typically begins with health-care providers. During prenatal care and often soon after a woman has given birth, doctors, nurses, and other clinicians can explain the benefits of breastfeeding and describe the proper technique. Nearly all births in the United States and Canada occur in hospital settings, and hospital practices in labor, delivery, postpartum care, and discharge planning can inform and support women who want to 1.

Micronutrients Almost all of the nutrients that infants require during the first 6 months can be met if they consume an adequate amount of breast milk. There are a few exceptions, though. Unless the mother is taking a large dose of Vitamin D, human milk will be low in vitamin D, which is needed for calcium absorption and building bone, among other things. Therefore, breastfed children often need to take a vitamin D supplement in the form of drops.

This chemical energy is converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work, allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories, denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a capital “C”) on nutrition food labels.

On average, an adult consumes just over two liters of water per day from food and drink combined. Since water is so critical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and output is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in Chapter 4. Micronutrients Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser amounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions. Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins. There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See Table 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2 “Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their major functions). In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, micronutrients are not sources of energy (calories), but they assist in the process as cofactors or components of enzymes (i.e., coenzymes).',\n",

Nutrients are substances required by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not synthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure, and/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and reproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body to function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or beneficial (such as antioxidants).4 | Introduction',\n",

The word protein comes from a Greek word meaning “of primary importance,” which is an apt description of these macronutrients; they are also known colloquially as the “workhorses” of life. Proteins provide four kilocalories of energy per gram; however providing energy is not protein’s most important function. Proteins provide structure to bones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most of the chemical reactions that take place in the body.
