        "sentence_chunk": "What is MES?MES stands for manufacturing execution system. Meaning a control system for monitoring and managing work and process on the factory floor. But that's an oversimplification of what a successful MES software implementation can do for manufacturers. MES provides detailed resource scheduling and status, production, dispatch, and sequencing, traceability, genealogy, inventory, quality assurance, maintenance, management, document control, performance, analysis, and more. MES is crucial for manufacturers because it exists in a space between business-oriented applications like ERP and SCADA HMI systems designed to directly control plant floor operations. While an ERP can help allocate resources, it lacks the level of detail that MES provides. MES allows for real-time, minute-to-minute, or quicker resource scheduling, as well as handling execution and dispatch. MES connects production to executive decision-making by controlling, tracking, and documenting the transformation of raw materials into finished goods in real-time. This information gives a current, accurate view of plant-floor operations, especially when combined with dashboards that display current statuses and rates, which can be compared to both historical data, as well as scheduled production goals.",

        "sentence_chunk": "Similarly, MES assists with recipe management, allowing organizations to formulate consistent methods for creating products from batch to batch, reducing waste while streamlining processes. Additionally, recipes can be easily updated and altered, quickly adding new products or adjusting the spec of current offerings. MES manages work in progress or WIP, inventory throughout various stages of production. By integrating with ERP and SCADA systems, MES automatically validates inventory levels at each stage, eliminating the need for manual verification. Related to WIP inventory is the concept of track and trace, which documents batches and individual products on their journey from raw materials to semi-finished goods, and finally to finish products. By tracking, organizations gain a complete picture of each unit and can instantly trace its path through production in the case of a quality fluctuation. All production facilities will have variations, deviations, and exceptions in terms of quality and accepted parameters. Connecting MES to a more granular SCADA system allows operators to see alarms that indicate in real time when units are out of spec. While not technically part of the system itself, overall equipment effectiveness or OEE is closely linked to MES. OEE considers three ratios.",

Using these ratios, organizations can analyze their operations, gain valuable insight, then improve production, and equipment throughput. A large factor in OEE is downtime tracking. Every minute of downtime on the plant floor means losing money and puts production behind schedule. Reducing or even eliminating downtime is vital to meeting production goals and becoming a more efficient organization. One of the best ways to implement an MES solution is to use the Ignition Software platform with sepasoft suite of MES modules. Ignition acts as the base with built-in tools to develop best testing class, SCADA, HMI solutions. With a server-centric architecture paired with an unlimited licensing model, Ignition brings cutting-edge automation software to both the plant floor and the boardroom. A versatile solution like the Ignition Perspective Module can easily connect data sources from across the organization, displaying that information on flexible dynamic dashboards and generating custom reports, all in a mobile responsive application.

We're 100% technology agnostic and independent. So this is meant to be a very objective ranking based on a number of criteria including the general capabilities within a manufacturing environment, the value for the money, the ROI that organizations typically realize, as well as the adoption rate among other manufacturers in the space. So without further ado, let's dive into our top 10 list. Coming in at number 10 is E2 shop system. And E2 is a standalone shop floor manufacturing execution system. And the reason I point this out is because some of the other systems in our top 10 list are systems that do other things in addition to MES, but E2 focuses exclusively on shop floor automation. Now, some of the advantages of E2 include the fact that it can handle, make-to-order, complex manufacturing environments.

Now just like every other system we're going to talk about here in the top 10 list, E2 also has weaknesses in addition to strengths. First and foremost, it's a product that can be expensive over time.the cost of the product can be a bit higher than some of the others in our top 10 list. The reporting isn't as strong as some of the other systems in our top 10 list and the general breadth of capability isn't as strong as some of the others in our top 10 list. But if you're a make-to-order or engineer-order manufacturer, E2 might be a good solution to consider. Coming in at number nine is SAP ME.

It also is very good at providing detailed production visibility into operations, as well as reporting in analytics. Those are some of the strengths of the SAP ME system. Now, some of the downside weaknesses of the product include the fact that there can be a steep learning curve for learning the product. It's not as easy to use and not as easy to learn as some of the other products in the marketplace. Not to be fair, that's because it is a very powerful tool which comes along with a certain amount of complexity and a certain learning curve.

And Fishbowl is a product that specializes more for small and mid-size manufacturing shops. So if you're a smaller manufacturer, you don't have super complex needs. You don't need all the complexities and all the robust capabilities of, say, NSAP, which we had just talked about, then Fishbowl might be a good option for you. Now, the biggest upside for Fishbowl are going to be its ease of use. It's not as complex, it's not as hard to learn as some of the other systems in the marketplace.

So if you are looking for a system that can do more than just the shop floor management in the manufacturing execution, then you may want to look to one of the other systems in our top 10 lists that are more broader enterprise-wide technologies that can also integrate to financials and other parts of your business. But having said all of that, that's enough to land fishbowl in number eight on our list. Coming in at number seven is manufacturing D365, which is often used by manufacturers to automate their shop floors.

And then finally, the other big strength of Microsoft Dynamics 365 is the fact that it's easy to configure, customize, and integrate. It's a pretty open platform. It has that Microsoft flexibility that a lot of us are used to, and so that can be a strength of the product as well, especially if you have unique needs and you know you're going to need to tailor the software to fit your needs. Now the downside risk of D365 is because it is a broad big system that does more than just manufacturing execution, it creates a lot of complexities. It can take time to implement. The setup and the learning curve can be a bit difficult, at least just in terms of establishing and implementing the software. And finally, the cost can be a bit higher than some of the other products that we considered in our top 10 list.

Especially if you're a small to mid-size organization that's looking to implement an enterprise-wide technology, Netswe can be a great option because it does everything that an enterprise needs from financials, inventory management to warehouse management to other functions including manufacturing. Now, some of the benefits of Netswe include the fact that it's a SaaS or a cloud-based system that allows you to deploy the technology a bit faster, although learning the technology and actually deploying it into your business takes a bit longer. But the technical implementation and setup itself can be a bit faster than some of the other systems in our top 10 list. It's also a product that integrates with other systems fairly easily. So if you do need to tie into any legacy or regulatory base systems, next we can be a good option. Now the downside of a next week is that it can include some costs that creep up on you over time. So the recurring subscription costs and all the escalators and kickers that kick in over time is the company grows and as you increase transaction volumes that can actually increase in escalate fairly quickly or more quickly than you might be comfortable with. So that's something to fully understand is what is your total cost of ownership in the long term for using a product like NetSuite. Another downside is that NetSuite is known in notorious for difficult implementations in that they typically don't provide very hands-on or robust implementation capabilities from NetSuite themselves.",

But having said all of this and especially if we factor in the adoption rate of net suite which is very high for small and mid-size organizations, this is enough for net suite to land number six on our list. Coming in at number five on our list is aption. An aption is a software vendor that's actually grown up through the acquisition of several different manufacturing based ERP systems. And manufacturing is their core area of focus. They don't do a whole lot outside of manufacturing. One of the strongest areas of their focus is food and beverage manufacturing.

It also does financials, inventory management, supply chain, warehouse management, et cetera. So if you're looking for a more complete solution that does not just manufacturing, but also integrates to other sorts of business processes, aption might be worth considering. So along with the strengths, come a couple of weaknesses of aption. And one is that the product is harder to configure and set up when compared to other systems in the marketplace, or at least that's the feedback we get from some of our clients. And when compared to other software vendors and the frequency of updates to the software, aption tends to be a little slower and some of the other products when it comes to R&D and getting upgrades and updates out to their customers.

So it's not exactly suitable for multiple locations or as suitable as some of the other systems in our top 10 list. The yearly licensing is known to be somewhat cumbersome and costly, although that pricing model is evolving as they migrate more to Infore Cloud Suite, which is more of a cloud-based subscription-based model, but the pricing is a bit confusing to some of our customers.

Now some of the downside weaknesses of Epicor include, first of all, the fact that it can be hard to find some of the more advanced features. So while in one hand it is a system that's easier to use and learn, some of the more advanced capabilities are a bit harder to figure out. So really making sure that you train your people and that they fully understand the capabilities of the software is even more important for Epicor than other types of systems.

The product also has very robust real-time monitoring features, so it provides better visibility into real-time data, which not all the systems can do as well as IQMS.

This is due to the capability of an MES to optimize business processes in the production supply chain, improve product quality and ensure the safety of manufacturing processes. This article provides practical advice on how to make the implementation of an MES solution a success story. The article examines various production architectures and the associated process workflows and states criteria to determine benefits and functional scope of an MES. The required functions and interfaces are listed and implementation strategies are introduced.

Would you not prefer a situation like this: your personnel is equipped with RF hand-held terminals and can inquire the activities next in line at any place and at any time; your operators thus execute the required activities as specified. And on top: a complete, electronic documentation and a statement about the performance and status of your production and packaging upon the click of a button. A Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is at the core of such a scenario. An MES controls, optimizes, and documents business processes executed on the shop floor in full compliance with all the pharmaceutical requirements. It is the goal of an MES to increase security and reliability of the manufacturing process and to improve product quality. MES solutions are suitable for different processes including chemical or biochemical manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as the subsequent processing of such APIs in solid and liquid pharmaceutical forms. MES solutions are not isolated but a core component of the entire supply chain IT architecture. In 1998, AMR created the REPAC Model (Ready, Execute, Process Control, Analyze, Co-ordinate) and thus laid the foundations for the basic understanding of the necessity to use an MES. An autonomous MES enables the support and optimization of business processes by means of software functions.",

However, despite the importance of such a structured approach it cannot be denied that the decision for or against the benefits of an MES system frequently involve factors that are not measurable in economic terms.2.1 Objectives Typical goals to be achieved by the implementation of an MES system are: \u2022 Optimizing of the entire supply chain with the MES system best suitable for controlling workflows and procedures \u2022 Improving process safety and reliability \u2022 Recognition of deviations at an early stage \u2022 Immediate documentation of process steps \u2022 Improved data quality for assessing processes and products \u2022 Visibility and transparency throughout the entire production process: only deviations are to be analyzed, a detailed examination of the normal flow of operations is no longer required \u2022 Reduction of storage costs due to reduced lead times (WIP) \u2022 Reduction of administrative work for maintaining manufacturing documents \u2022 Creating and approving master batch records  \u2022 Reducing the number of lost batches \u2022 Reduction of operating costs due to a high level of integration and thus prevention of isolated solutions \u2022 Rapid access to current data: management based on up-to-the-minute information for all critical business cases \u2022 Complete 21 CFR Part 11 compliance also for lower-level systems",

These structures can be classified according to specific criteria. This classification can be used to define the different benefits levels of an MES for a particular production architecture in detail and by degrees. Moreover, such a classification also leads to different implementation concepts for an MES system. It would be wrong to claim that there is one software solution to provide optimal support for the respective type of production. Obviously, such structures can only be regarded in a rather abstract way. Thus, in concrete cases there may be deviations from the general patterns. For this reason, it is always advisable to analyze a concrete example. In this article, we only consider regulated production areas operating on the basis of master batch records.

In the context of integration, the state of the art achieved by now provides good technical safety if adhering to standards like ISO S95, ISO S88, or Namur NA 94. Solutions for individual industry segments are developed, which require only reduced development efforts and implementation times. How are the required functionalities to be distributed to the involved systems?This is a question frequently discussed when an enterprise plans to implement an MES system. The distribution of functions to various systems which support the individual task in the best possible way is a common task and can be solved without major problems. However, it is not only necessary to distribute the data but also to define which system is primarily managing the respective data.

On the other hand, equipment interfacing involves some effort for integration and qualification. Once such a system is running and validated, MES users can add originally acquired operating data or rather sophisticated conversions to their batch records. The MES collects such operating data in a production database (Historian Database) and places relevant data available for the manufacturing report. The production database enables all kinds of analysis which may also involve further data of the MES. Operating data (such as temperature, pressure, or alarms) can be acquired by DCS systems for process control as well as by SCADA systems for machine visualization, PLCs for machine control, or by manual data input. Online queries are possible at each process step. Due to a time stamp and the batch time frame (start/end of batch) the data are assigned to a produced batch. The interface requires special attention if a DCS system is used to integrate equipment which at the same time presents a recipe-driven batch system.",

In this context, the GAMP V-model has become generally accepted in the pharmaceutical industry. The V-model divides the production and maintenance of software systems into the phases Design Qualification, Development Implementation, Factory and Site Acceptance Test, Installation Qualification (IQ), Operational Qualification (OQ), Performance Qualification (PQ), and Ongoing Qualification. All these phases have to be concluded with a verification to prove that all the requirements for the respective phase have been fulfilled.

In a pilot phase an existing, operational standard system (MES product) demonstrates the functions that are available or missing in the implementation. The findings can then be considered as improvement in the next phase, the implementation phase. Such improvements may not only concern the software but also the workflows.

Unless key users get the necessary experience in handling the new system and an understanding of the objectives to be achieved by installing this system, the management will run the risk of loosing the users\u2019 support.

This applies in particular to EBR functions since their scope is strongly influenced by parameters set for the master batch record. It is to be noted that depending on the complexity of procedures and the number of products to be manufactured, customization activities lasting up to several months are not uncommon. In general, master batch records exist on paper already and their contents are known. But effective operation of an MES is related to the availability of well-structured master batch records in the system. They are essential to profit from advantages as provided by predefined building blocks. Reusable description elements are a core factor in reducing the effort for creating master batch records considerably and consistently. The required restructuring of data existing on paper represents an intellectual challenge that should not be underestimated. The best way to solve the problem is to integrate process engineers, who are well-trained in defining master batch records, right from the start phase of the project.7 Case Studies 7.1 Production of Pharmaceutical Solids - Bayer Health Care  Bayer HealthCare, a subgroup of Bayer AG, is one of the world's leading companies in the health care and medical products industry, combining the global activities of its Animal Health, Biological Products, Consumer Care, Diagnostics and Pharmaceuticals divisions More than 34,000 employees work for Bayer HealthCare worldwide.",

Each year several billions of tablets leave Bayer's manufacturing facilities for pharmaceutical solids in Leverkusen. Such highly sophisticated production facilities demand software-based support during all phases of production to ensure that patients get a drug of stable quality.7.1.1 Purchased Software to Profit from the Experience of Other Users  Bayer started looking for a manufacturing execution system that offered the \"customary comfort\", met today's and tomorrow's GMP compliance requirements and was apt to support optimal material flow control, reliable user guidance and paperless production with electronic signatures. At first, Bayer was not sure whether to use in-house development or purchase a market software package.

This is essential since the manufacturing of solid pharmaceuticals is characterized by a large number of recipe variants. Several hundred recipes are not uncommon. Thus, the administration and creation of Master Batch Records with all relevant order and batch data is one the system's core functions. With the objective to obtain high throughput and productivity the recipes are structured so that they may be executed on different machines. It must be possible to switch between different equipment without any problem. A change of equipment required while the process is running is a real challenge, and fortunately only happens rarely. Any modification of the batch record needs to be visible in the documentation, but any impact on the Master Batch Record has to be avoided. Also during \"normal\" batch record execution the collected data are continuously compared to the stored recipe.",

Following an initial phase of familiarization, the user satisfaction was complete. The use of mobile RF terminals has proven a real success. The operators truly welcome the high degree of mobility and the safe guidance guaranteed during the execution of orders. In using the MES, Bayer has been able to further optimize pharmaceutical safety, to substantially increase the transparency of the material flow, and to implement measures for boosting efficiency of the manufacturing process.7.2 Biotechnical Production - Boehringer Ingelheim  Boehringer Ingelheim is a research-driven group of companies dedicated to researching, developing, manufacturing and marketing pharmaceuticals that improve health and quality of life.

In the new API facility Boehringer Ingelheim will produce highly innovative biopharmaceuticals. These advanced products are the result of many years of extensive pharmaceutical research and, without a doubt, represent cutting-edge performance in pharmaceutical production skills. A vital contribution to this process is the MES system by Werum, which has been tailored to meet the very specific requirements of biotechnological production. Over the last years, no other project in Europe's pharmaceutical industry has gained as much notice as the new active ingredient plant of Boehringer Ingelheim in Biberach, Germany. As the largest cell culture plant in Europe, it set a new record in development and construction, and currently surpasses all others in terms of technology. In less than three years, more than Euro 255 million has been invested in this biotech complex. Just imagine: more than 18,000 cubic meters of",

For a smooth flow of production it is essential that the batch record is structured consistently to ensure the manufacturing of products of constant form and stable quality. The monitoring process in the active ingredient plant involves about 10,000 sensors and actuators distributed over 150 pieces of equipment, supplying essential data or carrying out instructions. With more than 1,000 processing operations executed in the Biberach plant, any action, i.e. every touch of a button, every temperature reading, and every transfer, is executed according to precise instructions and is subject to complete documentation. The MES system guides the operator safely and step by step through each work segment and prevents errors in operation. The importance of such a system for quality assurance can hardly be over-emphasized - being well aware of this, Boehringer Ingelheim started the BIOMES project as early as May 1999.7.2.3 Manual and Automatic Sequences Alternating The main challenge that the MES has to face is that in biotechnological production, automated workflows alternate with manual operations. For this reason, the automated sequences are first filed in the DCS recipe system and transferred to the MES. The MES then links these automated sub functions to the manual operations and consistency checks (e.g. batch or equipment status).",

On execution of automated sequences the DCS returns the result parameters to the MES. As the controlling system, the MES continually displays the current status of all processes including DCS. On completion of a manufacturing stage, the MES generates complete associated documentation. The entire electronic process monitoring is designed to act as an early warning system. Trend calculations are used to detect and report deviations even before they actually occur, so that the operator has enough time to take corrective measures. On-line booking of every process step and every material consumption makes it possible to follow the process flow directly. Another essential task of the MES is the monitoring of cleaning and sterilization status, including expiration dates for all related equipment, such as containers, pipe systems, and set-up parts. The risk of contamination is minimized, since the system would, for instance, issue an alarm as soon as an unsterilised pipe is to be used.",

The MES serves as a data \"turntable\" and ensures consistent data flow between SAP and DCS environment.8 Outlook The cost-benefit ratio obtained by the implementation and operational use of an MES system always depends on the capabilities provided by the basic technologies. Today's new technologies show a trend towards open structures. In the field of basic software technologies J2EE is such an open standard. There is no longer the need to stick to one particular supplier. Further examples are XML and OPC interfaces, which facilitate a standardized data exchange. Currently, new technologies are launched at rapid pace enabling many other optimizations at low costs. Among these new trends are:  \u2022 Web-based functions: use of intranet/internet functions \u2022 Mobile computing: use of mobile computers/handhelds \u2022 PAT: analysis and intervention in realtime to avoid errors instead of analyzing them afterwards \u2022 Modularization: use of J2EE, CORBA software architectures enabling an open system environment (best of breed) with standardized interfaces.",

Although they are generally presented as MES (Manufacturing Execution System), the scope of these solutions ranges from \u201eMy Excel Sheet\u201d to comprehensive management, organization, and automated processing of all production-related processes. This brochure is not another attempt to define the term Manufacturing Execution System. Rather, in issuing this brochure, the objective of the ZVEI Working Group \u201eMES\u201d is to provide the interested reader and the professional audience with an overview of currently existing or feasible solutions which fulfill differing industry-specific requirements. The objective of this brochure is to promote the utiliza- tion of suitable MES applications for optimized production. The working group has used the \u201eEnterprise-Control Systems Integration \u2013 IEC 62264\u201d set of standards as a basis for product and vendor independent presentation of the functionality. Chapters 1 through 3 provide a short introduction to this standard which is also known as S95. Currently, different terminol- ogy for the same MES terms and tasks is used across industries and even among vendors. Therefore, Chapter 4 classifies the most important terms based on the S95 structure and terminology, providing guidance through the multitude of different terms and products. Based on industry-typical requirements, chapter 5 presents the opportunities and benefits of MES func- tions.",

Furthermore, integration of the extended supply chain and global procurement as well as the regional corporate sales presence in developing markets is required. MES is not only the operational link between \u201eproduction\u201d and \u201eenterprise\u201d but also links all partners within the supply chain. This enables a continuous, holistic, and manageable value stream. On this basis, MES is emerging as a strategic element for flexible and integrated production. A MES combines all tasks of modern production management in a comprehensive software system for today. At the same time, this system is the operational platform for any enterprise evolving towards the \u201edigi- tal factory\u201d of the future.1\t Market requirements and reasons for using MES In order to evaluate the state of the art and the development of MES solutions, the place of MES in the history of automation must be considered. Today\u2019s MES solutions include former CIM components such as CAP (Computer Aided Planning), CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing), CAQ (Computer Aided Quality Assurance), PDA (Production Data Acquisition), MDA (Machine Data Acquisition), and PTR\u2006/\u2006T&A (Personnel Time Recording, Time & Attendance). However, these CIM components were not thoroughly integrated into the corporate processes.",

        "sentence_chunk": "Instead, they were mostly used as single purpose applications on department level. Due to increasing corporate integration as well as better understanding of internal and external value chains, more integrated soft- ware solutions were required in order to better support manufacturing companies. For these reasons, comprehensive MES solutions are increasingly used and recognized by the process and manufacturing industries. This trend is accelerated by the ongoing economic globalization which requires maximized competitiveness. The following goals must be accomplished: \u2022 Improving productivity factors while increasing flexibility \u2022 Higher production process efficiency \u2022 Enhancing and ensuring process and product quality \u2022 Overall process and cost optimization \u2022 Shortening of product life cycles The driving forces for using MES are new production-related developments, new production and logistic concepts as well as changed products and product development processes. Product life cycles continue to shorten while the technological complexity of products increases. At the same time, development time is reduced, more prototypes are required, and more product variants are demanded. In a global and competitive economy, \u201etime to market\u201d is a critical and deciding factor for the success of any manufacturer. MES can contribute significantly to that success. The sustained improvement of the corporate value chain within the context of the requirements listed above calls for a set of tools which not only supports individual departments but considers \u201ethe produc- tion\u201d as a holistic process within the enterprise.",

The terms, concepts, and models defined in IEC 62264 provide a standard terminology for the integra- tion of the corporate and production management levels. This improves communication between all stakeholders in MES projects. The standard also facilitates best integration practices for the integration between the corporate and production management. At the same time, the standard is independent of the degree of automation and the use of particular technologies.

They represent a bridge between functions typically considered as belonging to ERP, and the functions implemented in levels 1 and 2 of the functional hierarchy (see figure 1). All of these core functions consist of different individ- ual elements, which provide or process information. This operational information can be categorized as follows: \u2022\t Definition information \u2013 Specification of operations to be carried out and the required resources \u2022\t Capability information \u2013 Resource properties \u2022\t Schedule/request information \u2013 Scheduling and execution \u2022\t Performance/response information \u2013 Feedback of performance and results The different areas of Manufacturing Operations Management follow a generalized activity model (Figure 5), which describes the interaction of the individual elements. The activities themselves consist of specific tasks, which differ according to the functions which need to be performed. The individual activities are linked by information flows. The specific information exchanged between the activities depends on the respective functions. The activities and the information exchange are implemented by MES software products, which are function, industry, or product specific.

Maintenance Resource Management covers information about the resources required for maintenance orders and work: standard and special tools, internal and external personnel (with appropriate exper- tise and qualifications), maintenance documentation as well as spare parts and consumables needed to perform maintenance work. The state of resources includes the equipment\u2019s health status, capa- bilities, availability, expected utilization, location, and location accessibility.

Constraints such as technological sequences as well as optimized set-up times and production quantities are also incorporated. Detailed Scheduling optimizes machine utilization, provides computer-based rescheduling due in case of changes (priority or express orders), and clearly displays the process execution. Thus, it ensures on-time and optimized production runs. Detailed Scheduling tools are mainly used for single-part production, but also in serial production using non-interlinked equipment.

The system was developed in the early 1950\u2018s as part of the Toyota Production System. Kanban is an approach whereby the \u201epull\u201c for resupply is created by material consumption. As such, the production is controlled and the material is supplied solely on the basis of the material consumed in production. The cards are the basic element of this control system and transmit the necessary informa- tion. Kanban loops can significantly reduce material inventory for production while simultaneously increase delivery reliability. Today the physical card transfer is steadily replaced by computer-based information transfer. This is generally referred to as eKanban.",

In addition, previously distinctly separate product lines are now used in both industries. In order to guide the reader, the following chapters first provide a general description of the respective typical operational process, followed by a tabular overview of the individual operational activities in production, quality, maintenance, and inventory management which are supported by MES modules. The following description of the general operational process provides a simple and straightforward overview of the main characteristics of each industry in order to correlate the functionality and applica- tion of the described MES modules. In the pharmaceutical industry, active ingredients are produced by chemical or biotechnical processes (plant extracts, chemical synthesis, or biotechnological fermentation). The manufacturing process is subject to government regulations, which are generally summarized by the term \u201ecurrent Good Manufacturing Practices\u201c (cGMP). In the following example, the operational requirements and possibilities of applying MES modules are demonstrated for the chemical production of active ingredients in a flexible multi-product plant with automatic batch control.

Starting at about 100.000 hl\u2009/\u2009a, breweries run the entire production process with a fully integrated automation solution. Large breweries operate as fully automatic production plants monitored from a central control room. The main functions of MES are quality assurance, support of production scheduling including data for material flow and inventory, and evaluation of production with special focus on product quality and efficiency. MES is regarded as the core function for goal-oriented support of production. Proprietary systems exceeding the scope of office software products are typically found in breweries producing about 500.000 hl\u2009/\u2009a. Because of the continuing concentration within the brewing industry into large, interna- tionally operating concerns, the comparison of sites using selected performance indicators has also become increasingly important. MES provides these performance indicators. The internal organization of production within a facility covers two main areas, namely brewing and bottling, i.e. the production of ready-for-sale beer from the raw materials and packaging into various containers. Both areas require different organization and MES functions.",

Nevertheless, func- tions like production planning and scheduling, optimized utilization of resources as part of process management, securing plant availability, and quality control are fundamentally important. Thus, these industries also use MES functionalities, although not in a single software environment. There is a selection of specifically tailored applications available to handle the specific tasks, some of which are integrated and communicate with centrally managed and openly accessible databases. The purpose of these applications is improved operational performance, greater transparency of run- ning procedures, and identification of production alternatives. Generally accepted standards for opera- tional processes based on international norms are increasingly used in this industry, too. However, at this time, fully standardized software solutions and consistently efficient procedures are not yet availa- ble. The need to link production and enterprise management is becoming increasingly urgent, espe- cially in light of the changes in global demand and unsettled economic conditions. Therefore, this link is increasingly implemented.",

Figure 10 provides an overview of the entire value chain.

The LP models optimize an objective value \u2013 usually profitability \u2013 which depends on crude oil data, market-driven economic requirements, and present operational constraints. In addition, non-linear simulation models and so-called flow sheet simulators are used for further calculations. The available tools allow interconnected simulation of dif- ferent production areas. The result is optimized selection of suitable crude oil grades for specific refiner- ies with regard to the required product mix, material and energy requirements as well as CO2 emission. The delivered material is verified (LIMS) and included in inventory management. Based on these data, crude oil disposition, allocation to process units, and subsequent product blending is scheduled. The scheduling data are then transferred to process control tools and systems which use the data for opti- mized operation strategies, for example based on Advanced Process Control (APC).",

This simplifies the adjustment of process parameters and enforces a structured and consistent implementation. The production can be evalu- ated with regard to process units and produced batches. Overall, recipe control provides better overview and transparency of the operational correlations. Especially for enterprises with multiple locations, or multiple linked production plants at the same location, MES tools very effectively plan, monitor, and control the entire supply chain.5.4.1 General description of typical operations Because of the variety of different plant types in the chemical and specialty chemical field, there is no typical operational process. However, the role of specific elements in specific operational phases can be shown in general. In general, the first element is the analysis of the market demand which in turn is used for definition of production planning requirements (make-to-order). Production orders resulting from planning are dispatched as campaigns by operations, and divided into individual batches and assigned to available units. Checking the availability of ingredients and the required capacity for product storage and shipment are also part of dispatching.",

At the same time, manual dispatching, assignment, and monitoring of resources are still common in less complex environments. The higher the product diversity, the more important becomes the systematic use of tools for supply chain management from an economic point of view. Especially in multi-product plants, these tools schedule and monitor the raw material supply and inventory with specific consideration of market avail- ability and cost. Based on a product\u2018s manufacturing specification, the procedure is carried out automatically (recipe), semi-automatically (recipe processing with manual interaction) or completely manually. Modular recipe software which can be implemented as an MES module or as a function in the control system supports flexible, transparent, and self-documenting operation even for complex processing requirements and plant structures. Continuous monitoring of the quantity and composition of ingredients and integrated quality measure- ment of intermediate or finished products support smooth and specification-compliant production. This may require specifically prepared analyses involving the laboratory as well as implementation of a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). A LIMS contains directives for taking and evaluating samples, stores the collected data, and transfers the data to plant-wide information systems. Contemporaneous evaluation of batch operations is supported by specific MES modules.",

The chemical and specialty chemical industry is characterized by a wide variety of processes, products, and plant types. A given plant may use continuous and semi-continuous processes as well as typical batch processes with a range of less than ten to several hundred products or product variants product formulas. This results in a broad range of requirements on the respective plants, the necessary automation con- cepts, and the process complexity. The requirements and implementation of the associated MES modules vary accordingly. Especially in multi-product plants, parallel production in possibly identical plant sections with flexible production lines is available. In dedicated plants, a product change may require equipment or piping changes. The ingredients are usually added from tanks using pipes, or from containers (drums, big-bags, etc.). In this type of plants, software for batch management including modularly structured recipes, coordinated process control, and flexible unit allocation has become a commonly used standard. In continuous processes, product changes tend to be rare.",

The availability of plant has to be ensured (no repairs), production parameters must remain within specified limits, and product quality must com- ply with product specifications (tolerances, gap sizes, surface quality, etc.). In addition to sensors for process parameters such as pressures, currents, voltages, temperatures, and sizes, quality monitors are installed at relevant locations in the assembly line to verify the specified quality (e.g. light tunnel to determine paint surface quality). Furthermore, spot checks are performed and evaluated in detail. The collected production and quality data sets are assigned to a product which is partly required by law. Even after delivery, the collected data are maintained by the manufacturer and linked to the product ID (usually the chassis number). The vehicle assembly (motor, transmission, chassis, and interior) is still characterized by manual interac- tion.

OEM: The state of the art allows mixed production of several car models on the same assembly line with a very large number of variations. For example, it has become common that an assembly line produces no identical cars for an entire month. Supplier: In view of the increasing number of product variants and the pressure to reduce production costs, sup- pliers must combine flexible manufacturing systems with the earlier \u201esingle-product assembly line\u201c concept. This requires increasing flexibility while providing high quality and throughput.5.5.1\t General description of typical operations OEM perspective of operations Production scheduling In multi-variant serial manufacturing, production equipment is usually completely interconnected.

In the supplier industry, a large number of companies operate with classical serial production or order- based production of small series. A product is produced in different variants and partly in large quanti- ties. Unit-based sequencing as used in vehicle assembly is not required.

Production scheduling The timed requests to OEMs in dependence on their logistical con- cepts, for example Order-to-Stock, JIT, and JIS provide the basis for production scheduling and control. These logistical concepts dele- gate the flexibility to the suppliers who must design and control production capacities accordingly. This generally precludes a com- plete interconnection of production systems covering multiple prod- uct stages. Production preparation Production preparation for suppliers is generally comparable with the characteristics described above for automobile manufacturers (OEMs). Materials are commissioned based on orders or provided demand- driven and partly automatic in case of series production. Personnel are scheduled based on assembly line and production structures. The plans are based on demand, tasks, and the shift schedule. The allocation of working stations is determined by production structures.

Production preparation for fully automated processes (SMD, interconnected assembly lines, quality test- ing systems, etc.)must ensure that the manufacturing and testing programs required for the different product variants are prepared and can be made available automatically.

Production execution Series production begins with production scheduling and entry of a production order into the relevant systems (request management, commissioning, etc.). If products are manufactured with a serial number, it is often defined in the first stage of the process. It uniquely identifies the product and is used to determine the status of the product (order). Satisfying production requirements and thus guaranteeing specified product quality as well as optimized utilization of production resources represent major goals.

For made-to-order manufacturing, not all required process steps and equipment must necessarily be available at the same location. In many cases, production steps in the middle of the manufacturing process are outsourced. From the MES point of view, this kind of outsourcing presents a challenge in that the object is first removed from and then reentered into the system. During the duration of the outsourcing, generally no information about the current progress state is available. This results in increased requirements for monitoring completion dates. Building special machinery is complicated by the fact that each machine is unique.

Steel slabs usually weigh around 15-25 tons. Typical batch (heat) sizes range from 120 to 150 tons, and the typical throughput of a steel plant is 50 to 100 t\u2006/\u2006h. This results in an hourly product value of 40.000 to 200.000 Euro. Since the production processes in both industries are also very energy-intensive, a well running MES is vitally important. Paper and metal products are manufactured in complex processes which require many of the common MES functions. The production typically consists of multiple manufacturing steps between which mate- rial is stored and transported. Thus, inventory management plays an important part. The character of the manufacturing processes is hybrid: The initial processes such as pulping or blast furnace operation are continuous. They are followed by batch or campaign processes (pulp preparation, foundries). The final set of processes is discrete and batch-oriented with separating instead of aggregating production steps.",

Product or grade switching is minimized due to the generally high changeover costs. Thus, MES or manual scheduling methods are used to convert customer orders into production orders. Production is often executed in campaigns in order to minimize costly changeover times for the paper machine or steel plant, and to optimize productivity. A particular grade or quality is produced within a campaign. Individual products appear only in subsequent phases, for example in the cutting process in paper production. Only at this phase, the desired products such as rolls or sheets in different dimensions and possibly with special coatings are finally produced. Production scheduling requires: a)\t Definition of product properties by means of inventory numbers (articles available in stock) instead of unique material numbers. This procedure is used in both industries for processing customer orders.b)\t Forecasting data for campaign planning (especially in heavy industry).",

These recipes define the production proce- dures and production parameters needed to convert the raw materials into products. In addition, the recipe definitions ensure that the production process is executed within the specified tolerances. Recipes can also be managed and executed on the control system level (DCS). If such \u201cintelligent\u201d sub- systems are integrated in the MES environment, the executing intelligence shifts from the MES applica- tion to the equipment control level.

During the assembly process, this component is integrated in larger components and eventually in the final product. The component\u2019s data are included in the product record. Production guidelines and regulations have to be taken into account. Both the process and manufacturing industries are facing the continued challenge of engineering and design integration between the involved automa- tion levels which hinges on the \u201csingle point of information\u201d principle.6\t Essential similarities and differences between MES applications  \t in the process and manufacturing industries Today\u2018s high-performance operations management concepts must handle ever more varied require- ments, and be able to respond flexibly to a multitude of challenges.

For both industries, mastering these challenges is a basic requirement for increasing the own competi- tiveness and succeeding in the global marketplace. Both industries implement a multitude of specialized solutions for their respective specific problems. However, in addition to basic MES tasks which are inherently comparable, there are many structural analogies which can lead to common solution concepts. Mutual appreciation of the respective similari- ties and differences will assist in the implementation of such solutions and help in breaking down bar- riers between the industries. Hybrid production facilities in particular will benefit directly from this approach. The following chapter presents the immediately visible similarities and structural analogies between both industries. The chapter after that highlights the distinguishing characteristics.

In the manufacturing industry, intermediate and final products generally consist of a high number of individual components. In addition, this industry\u2019s production process is characterized by highly interconnected equipment with little buffer storage. Therefore, MES applications are often used for controlling interconnected production steps in the manufacturing industry. These manufacturing industry characteristics require effective management of a demanding supply chain. The requirements on MES applications for data update, completeness, consistency, volume, and processing speed are higher than in the process industry. Manufacturing plants frequently employ equipment from different vendors which often implement het- erogeneous data processing and MES solutions. Comprehensive and integrated control systems are less common in the manufacturing industry than in the process industry.

Unlike discrete manufacturing which uses the ERP system, the process industry defines the production instructions (i.e. master recipes) in the MES or DCS recipe module. The master recipes are subject to stringent test and validation procedures before they can be used for production. The latter aspects are particularly important for the pharmaceutical and food and beverage industries for guaranteeing prod- uct safety. In the process industry, most measurements are continuously collected and archived in the form of plots or trends. The archive time spans are generally measured in years. Since the measured values and the resulting plots can change quickly, the archives must be designed accordingly. In this environment, standard SQL databases are generally less suitable due to their limited performance. Instead, special database are used which support processing large volumes of fast changing measured values and use special algorithms for compression and reduction of collected data.7\t Practical advice for approaching MES projects This chapter presents a number of tips and recommendations which have proven themselves in practice during the implementation of MES.",

Thus, MES solutions are a key factor in an enterprise\u2018s pursuit of operational excellence, and are closely related to analysis and optimization of operational processes. The following areas show the optimization potential associated with introduction of MES: \u2022 Increased transparency of inventory and production capacity and thus \t - Online access to possible delivery dates at order entry, \t - Improved analysis with regard to requested delivery dates and total delivery costs, \t - Faster planning and order fulfillment, \t - Increased delivery reliability, \t - Higher flexibility in response to changes, \t - More efficient plant utilization.\u2022 Reduction of errors and defects by permanent computer-based monitoring of all important produc- tion parameters. \u2022Reduction of production costs and better utilization of plant capacity as a result of computer-based production planning and scheduling. \u2022Reduction of set-up times by optimization of plant allocation.\u2022 Inventory reduction (raw materials, finished products) by improved planning, and more flexible and demand-oriented production. \u2022More effective procedures by networking and comprehensive data exchange between involved operational and automation levels (ERP, MES, DCS). \u2022",

Two preparation lines and eight fermenters rep- resent the core of the plant. A total of 80 process units have been integrated in the overall concept, including cleaning units (WFI, purified steam, cleaning in place), chromatography, and filtration. Initial situation The operational processes and production decisions in the newly constructed active ingredient plant were to be supported by MES software already available on the market. Early on it became apparent that MES modules generally operate as standalone applications and can only communicate and exchange data with adjacent automation levels, especially control system functions, using specific interfaces. This often results in a variety of approaches and implementations offering insufficient interoperability and inconsistent operator environments. MES solution Readily available control technology and MES software were chosen for the management and control of the plant. The concept implemented both parts as an integrated environment across all automation levels while fulfilling regulatory requirements.

Innovative technology per se does not guarantee a secure future, but must be com- bined with the vendor\u2019s capability to provide long-term product maintenance and upgrade paths. Both factors are required for customers to benefit from vendor innovations without major new implementa- tions or adaptations. In retrospect, consistent process quality has turned out to be another benefit of automated production sequence planning and optimization. The software more or less forces implementation of the process which has been determined as the optimum, and thus contributes to consistent or improved product quality in an increasingly complex delivery chain. Process description Single-part manufacturing such as production of special-purpose machinery and industrial plants is characterized by small lot sizes of often one unit. Therefore, this industry optimizes not only the produc- tion and assembly process, but also associated engineering tasks as well as transportation logistics.",

Engineering then determines the assembly of the equipment from already available or special-construction parts. Therefore manufacturing is a com- bination of workshop management and partial new development. In both cases, external companies are generally involved and must be managed within the scope of the overall project.8.5 Single-part manufacturing  case study: MES from engineering  to transportation logistics 8 Ad d e d va lu e a n d b e n e f i t s 8  A d d e d va lu e a nd b e ne f i ts 79 78",

The reasons for this objective are avoidance of possibly very substantial contractual penalties and transportation reorganization cost. In this industry, transportation is a major cost factor because it requires special trucks, lifting equipment, rail cars, or ships which have to be booked months in advance. The MES introduction provided cost as well as schedule transparency which resulted in increased plan- ning security. The introduction of the MES increased delivery integrity to the point that the plant manuf- acturer was no longer subject to any contractual penalties and entirely eliminated transportation reor- ganization cost. Process description Production facilities in the paper industry produce paper and board from large quantities of ground- wood, pulp, and recycled paper together with water, chemicals and additives. The products range from lightweight tissue to heavy cardboard, which are subject to high quality requirements regarding proper- ties such as basis weight, caliper, brightness, and printability. In paper and converting plants, control- ling and visualization of material flows as well as continuous and comprehensive quality monitoring and traceability present crucial challenges.

The objective is to increase the total plant efficiency (OEE) by reducing inventory levels of raw material, intermediate and finished goods and by optimized use of energy. MES solution In close cooperation between the automation vendor and plant operator, modern and comprehensive MES solutions based on standardized platforms were introduced in two paper plants, one in Europe and the other in the USA. The MES solutions contribute to smooth coordination of production and material flows, provide decision support, and enable the visualization and documentation of important produc- tion and quality data. Added value and benefits For both plants, the comparison of production data before and after implementation demonstrates considerably improved profitability as a result of the MES introduction. Production efficiency increased by 1,2\u2006% and 4\u2006% respectively, largely because of reduction of trim loss and improved production quality. The intermediate inventory levels decreased by 25\u2006% and 35\u2006% respectively, freeing up 6,25 million Euro and 2.3 million Dollar of capital. In the European plant, customer complaints dropped by 59\u2006%. Until the introduction of the MES system, this was one of the most significant problems of this paper manufacturer.

The mate- rial flow transparency across the entire production chain results in improved customer service and more accurate delivery forecasts. In many cases product quality improves at the same time, because produc- tion flow can be more accurately controlled and requirements\u2006/\u2006recipes become more accurate and better traceable (figure 20). In particular for special products that are used in the food and beverage industry, traceability is becoming increasingly necessary.9\t Summary and outlook This brochure would not be complete without providing an outlook on upcoming developments and the future of MES. From the late 80\u2019s to the mid 90\u2019s, the concept of MES was primarily characterized by individual cus- tomerspecific MES projects. While many were successful, some struggled with software development difficulties which were typical of that time \u2013 incomplete specifications, poorly projected development costs as well as cost overruns and missed deadlines up to the cancellation of entire projects. The initial MES euphoria gave way in some respects to disillusionment, and deployment and benefit of MES tools were viewed more skeptically. This resulted in uneven proliferation of MES applications across different industries which is still noticeable today. The higher the complexity, production flexibility, and number of product variants, the more production benefitted from using MES modules and the more they were accepted.",

The purpose of this brochure is to illustrate the potential of MES solutions for applications in different industries and to provide a supplier-independent overview of currently available and feasible solutions. The troubles of early MES implementations have been solved. Both users and suppliers have learned their lessons and created a common understanding and language based on standards such as IEC 62264. Instead of being implemented as individual projects, MES solutions are largely assembled from con\u00ad figurable modules. The configurable portion usually represents 60 to 70\u2006%, and the customer-specific extensions make up 30 to 40% of the functionality. Additional standardization of data structures based on established corporate execution models and of transparent data transfer between applications will substantially advance innovation and deployment of MES applications. While the complexity of the applications requires continued examination of the success and benefits of MES projects, many projects have repeatedly proven the economic benefit of MES. The MES objectives must continue to be based on individual requirements and implemented accordingly. At the same time, increased industrial expertise regarding personnel requirements and quality ensures a higher optimiza- tion yield.",

Therefore, further proliferation of MES solutions in all industries is only logical.

        "sentence_chunk": "In view of these requirements, the concept of a single, all-encompassing MES solution must be retired. The future lies in a collaborative environment of multiple cooperating applications which are distributed across multiple functional levels (ERP, MES, and process control), corporate areas (production, mainte- nance, quality, and inventory management) and axes (enterprise, supply chain, life cycle). Technologies such Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), transactional data exchange via XML, and web services for easy access of other applications enable this kind of transformation. Users must be empowered to optimally fulfill their tasks by providing them with account and web based portals for accessing applications and overviews of all relevant corporate levels. At the same time, the specific distribution and interaction of the applications should be user-transparent. In the future, this will increasingly involve concurrent simulation and real-time optimizations. These will determine the best production alternatives based on specified criteria, and thus support the decision process. The MES future promises extra value and benefits for the users and exciting development opportunities for the vendors. In conclusion, the members of the working group and the authors of this brochure would like to wish all readers a successful implementation of their MES projects.

The task of the manufacturing system becomes even more challenging in the quest to use a common approach for different manufacturing plants and ever evolving manufacturing processes for specific plants. This thesis introduces a reference architecture that enables such changes between plants and updates within plants. For this, we use the paradigm of Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES). A developed MES architecture by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is used as the standard reference architecture. Its flexibility and scalability is applied to a specific steel melt-shop plant case study. In this case study the standard framework is specified through re-labeling standard data and modules to specifics tailored for the melt process of a generic steel plant. Since steel plants are faced with difficult scheduling and disturbance handling problems, specific intelligent algorithms are developed to deal with these issues through integrating some of the control into the MES. Conclusions as to the success of the algorithms along with supporting data and recommendations of further use for them are also included.",

Manufacturing and Management  When the optimization of a manufacturing process is considered there are several key issues which are prime targets for improvement or streamlining. These include; not meeting promised delivery dates, machines failing thus causing production to halt, inefficiencies in production flow due to bottlenecks, and failing to pass quality assurance (QA). These issues do not standalone, meaning significant improvement can be made if a proper system is in use to handle these problems in a mutual way. Now if the attention is shifted onto some of the contributions made to manufacturing on the plant floor more tangible forms of control are considered, such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs), robots and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). All these use automation; the idea of using computers to program and control production equipment. These controls however remain isolated on a localized level, which means each computer is focused on its specific task and does not know what the other computers are doing. More recently a higher level of control known as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) has come into use.",

Still all this data gathered by the data acquisition components of the system is large and disorganized and creates several important problems. It is important to decide whom in the company will need what data and whether it will be relevant by the time they receive it. Also, can someone read all this data and respond within the right time?When assessing the problem from the point of view of manufacturing in terms of production planning, the most prevalent tool used is Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP).",

It can also include Material Requirements Planning (MRP) \u2013 a planning tool made for creating manufacturing schedules for purchasing, accounting and inventory control. Given product quantities required from the master production schedule, the MRP determines the quantity to make or purchase. Lead-time is taken into the equation to determine when these items must be ordered or manufactured. Even with these sophisticated software packages, the execution does not always go according to plan. This is mostly due to inaccuracies in forecasting, production slowing down due to bottlenecking and process inefficiencies. As a result, \u201cthere exists a wide information gap, which is untenable in today\u2019s competitive world where customers expect instant fulfillment of orders at globally competitive prices and with the highest quality\u201d [18]. Clearly, there is something missing that can be implemented to greatly improve manufacturing. The machines residing on the plant floor and the planning taking place in the management offices for the use of those machines, does not seem to link in any distinct path. Higher-level functions may have an impact on lower level activities such as process control, and thereby an indirect effect on the process.",

MES REQUIREMENTS In the early 1980\u2019s, a number of companies used different size computer systems to assist manufacturing operations. At that time, the general term for these systems was Computer-Integrated Manufacturing (CIM).

To allow for this standard reusable application, MES requires broader system design considerations for all software and hardware to allow for full integration.

The concept of the information historian database where each computerized activity draws from and delivers data to the system is becoming increasingly important. Based on SP88 [17], the most fundamental driver for system integration is the need to improve the ability to continuously change a business to meet the changing market demands and utilize new technologies. The need of flexibility for future needs is also required when designing an MES. The design of the software (interface) and hardware (gateway) must have an easy method for expansion to meet the increasing needs of the company as new and better ideas emerge in MES and as operation upgrades to the production process occur. However, to achieve an integrated flexible manufacturing environment at an affordable cost it is evident that the work in the area has to be synchronized. With synchronization comes the need to breakdown all the requirements of the MES.

Some of the main areas of concern and problem issues that MES is faced with internally to the plant are the difficulties in interfacing with existing software and the level of detail that must be incorporated when implementing an MES from plant to plant. The first problem arises due to the different islands of automation found in a plant. These islands are sophisticated within their activities; however, difficulties arise from the portability of the information that is required from them. This is especially true when trying to incorporate MES into old existing systems that run on legacy software. The other area of concern comes from defining the details of the MES for a specific plant. What constitutes a good enterprise MES in one case may make it unsuitable in another.

The thesis then applies this MES framework to a plant- specific case study to show its application. With this framework a key parameter to consider is the frequency of information. As there is a wide disparity in the frequency of information polled by various systems, ranging from milliseconds to days, intermediate data storage and a transmission layer (process historian) are required. The quantity of information to be stored should be considered when determining the size of this buffer; since too small a database will make the system less effective but faster, and too large a database will make it slower and more expensive but more comprehensive.

Current good manufacturing practices (GMP) and exact record keeping requirements are enforced by strict FDA regulations for this industry. Information systems are required to deliver associated details on product quality, efficacy and genealogy. To add to this already multifaceted manufacturing process comes the complexity of using electronic records and signatures compliance (see standard 21 CFR Part 11 of the FDA, [20]). Manufacturers are dealing with these demands by stressing product quality, shortening new product introduction cycles, and reducing unit costs. In pharmaceutical operations product tracking is used to provide real-time visibility into batch/order status, on-line release of raw materials, WIP and finished goods. Here manufacturing visibility is needed to create a basis for the analysis, reporting, and trending needed to accelerate product lifecycle management.",

For a specific application that outlines the system architecture and functional description of an MES realized in the pharmaceutical industry refer to Fisher-Rosemount Systems [5].1.6.2.4. METAL MANUFACTURING In the steel manufacturing industry, management is faced with a competitive customer market, where high energy costs must be considered with the demands of increased quality at lower prices. To be competitive when it comes to meeting these demands MES must be used in order to produce on-time customer orders and shorter delivery cycles. Real-Time information direct from the floor is provided through the MES for production management to reduce re-processing rate and increase first-time quality production. In this market the competitive advantage must be obtained by combining better operational management with business systems to plant floor connectivity, just as MES offers. Improved quality, customer responsiveness and efficiency are fundamental business drivers.",

INTRODUCTION Manufacturing technology is finding new applications.\u201cThese do not come from generating more data, as current systems are overflowing with data already, but through a better job of integrating the information into more usable forms for more widespread use\u201d [13]. Some of the important factory floor information and activities are: resource allocation, dispatching production units, quality management, operations planning, detailed scheduling, labor management, product tracking, and keeping records of product genealogy. Systems that support linked sets of information flow and activities such as CAD, CAM, CAPP, ERP, control, and scheduling will be at an advantage from an integration perspective if these software systems can exchange data and messages (function calls) with each other in a wide-ranging computing environment. To provide a better understanding of where this is going, a set of foundation modules for manufacturing execution and a set of foundation interfaces are identified through universal object modeling in Interface Definition Language (IDL). The interfaces in this report are in their first stages, and are made to set the context for Manufacturing Planning and Execution Software interfaces development. Improvement updates of the interfaces will take place in the future as the technology and practices evolve.2.2.",

A heat of steel is the order placed by the customer and is defined by a specific grade and a specific weight.

The processing time associated with each machine unit is dependent on the grade of steel being processed and in some cases the available power consumption allowed.",

Only one grade of steel can be processed at a time and since cost is associated with the order of production (Section 3.2.2 will expand on this), the processing order of each grade of steel must be scheduled for the melt-shop. Many efforts have centered on obtaining optimal schedules given the logistical and economic importance of scheduling problems. Unfortunately, it has been proved that most scheduling problems of interest belong to the class of NP hard combinatorial problems, and the computational requirements for obtaining an optimal solution grow exponentially as the problem size (e.g., number of jobs and/or number of machines) increases [11]. These pure optimization methods are therefore impractical for industrial applications. For this reason we look at ways of handling optimal scheduling. This is defined as one that maximizes profit, and minimizes production time. The optimal scheduling of events within a steel production process becomes computationally more complex as the number of machines and jobs within the process increases. For this reason, an enumerative method for determining an optimal solution is not desirable. This raises a need for a method that can efficiently handle a multi-objective problem, as minimum cost and makespan are both required, and still produce an optimal schedule within a reasonable computational time.",

When making the schedule, there are 3 EAFs (EAFA, EAFB and EAFC) to choose from and these EAFs are coupled to the 3 LFs (LFA, LFB and LFC) respectively. This means there are 3 choices for a heat: EAFA and LFA, or EAFB and LFB and finally EAFC and LFC. Depending on the sequence of the order, a transition cost can occur (see Table 3.2 of Chapter 3). Also the makespan defines how long the production run will take in order to complete the scheduled sequence of heats. This time also is affected by the scheduled sequence, since queuing can occur between stages for the different heats. The following approach was chosen to encode the schedule into a chromosome.

DEFINING THE PENALTY FACTOR It is important in steel production to keep the Caster continuously flowing with molten steel. There is a downtime of 20 minutes needed, if the flow of molten steel has stopped after the Caster has begun being fed molten steel through the tundish. If the Caster is ready to cast the next heat of steel, and the next heat has not finished being heated in the Ladle Furnace, the Caster must be shut down and restarted. This introduces an extra 20 minutes of delay in the schedule, as seen in Table 4.2 with the vertical line cell between casting Grade A and B.

This is the case since Turnaround calls for having to start with a fresh cast, and starting with a new cast means there will be no transition with the current heat in the CC.4.4.4. Second Stage (EAF) Rescheduling  After the ordering of the active heats in the LFs is completed as described by the methodology in First Stage Rescheduling above, the next step is to choose the ordering for the active heats in the EAFs. This is done with a similar methodology to that of the LFs. First the algorithm considers if the active EAF heat can be poured without Turnaround occurring. This depends if there was any heats in the LF\u2019s at time of failure and on the processing time still needed for the EAF heat plus the next stage time needed to be processed by the LF.

The algorithm also gives a solution for least cost, if turnaround cannot be avoided for the active heats.

This however would mean that the active heats would be lost, and since the cost and time of redoing the active heats outweighs having a new optimal schedule from time of first turnaround, it is therefore not done.

This signal contains the information needed by the machines (EAFs and LFs) to define the routing time needed (heat times) for the day. This means based on the defined schedule for the day, determine the time needed for each heat at each machine, which defines the heating time on a machine. Since the machines in STATEFLOW run on a global clock, the times given to the machines must be in reference to this clock. The ga2sf.m algorithm determines these times and provides them with the schedule to the plant machines. This is needed to maintain priority to the defined sequence.

Specifically the heat times defined in Table 5.1 above are not exactly the times seen in the chart (Table 5.3). This is due to the restrictions caused by downstream processes (bottlenecking). The CC will always follow the values in Table 5.1 since this is a continuous process dictated by fluid flow, a physical property. However the times on the EAFs and LFs is not always fixed, since the LF must wait for the CC to accept its heat, and the EAF must wait for its LF to be freed up before passing along the heat. For illustration, heat 5 is accepted for LFA after heat 3 has been given to the CC, it is assumed that both transitions occur simultaneously with no delay. Heat 4 in LFB is not accepted until its previous heat 2 has been given to the Caster. This causes EAFB to hold heat 4 for an extra 80 minutes until heat 2 is taken away from LFB at time 200. This causes the times on the machines to be longer than the required heating time. It is assumed that this does not affect the physical properties since the heats are fully melted and simply maintaining that state.",

We have shown that they can improve the manufacturing performance as far as optimizing scheduling and handling power level and resource failure disturbances goes. The MES designed for the melt-shop works in theory. However, an improvement may be incorporated to alter the Decision Tree Algorithm by using the entire final population generated and applying a checking function that stores the alternative schedules found in the final population. This data contains alternative machines for certain heats in the sequence, but still maintains the same fitness function. This information can be included as alternatives depending on the plant status at failure for a more informative rescheduling of the machine failure disturbance problem. Due to the ever increasing pace of business, customers can change their priorities on an almost daily basis. The effect is that manufacturing priorities are shifted and production is lost through extended changeovers between processes.",

The MES must consider where in the schedule the new heat order can fit to maintain a continuous caster while using available resources, and minimizing the cost of transition steel. The shortest makespan should also be considered in this optimization problem, since adding a new heat to the schedule means adding more time to process for the day schedule. It is also recommended that quality disturbance handling be incorporated into the A433 Manage Heat Process module and A434 Manage Heat Quality. The A433 module provides the status at failure using the A6 module\u2019s Decode Decision Parameters Algorithm; however the A434 module needs an algorithm for QA Process Adjustments. Quality disturbances occur when chemical problems arise mainly from not meeting the correct specification. This could be anything from too much carbon in the steel to the presence of an impurity such as copper. This information is provided when the lab QA system has tested the steel, usually some time before entering the casting stage.\u201cTherefore, the immediate response is to keep running but adjust the operating parameters.

If the heat is downgraded to a different quality then the MES must look at its future schedule and see where the heat not passed can be done and if the downgraded heat can replace a similar heat that was up-coming in the schedule for the day.6.2. CONCLUSIONS Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) are needed to provide a software solution that can improve all areas of the manufacturing process including better performance, higher consistencies and quicker response to adapting needs from customers, suppliers and internal processes.

These systems simply author what MES should execute while still allowing MES to maintain and manage the production orders, and provide intelligence for optimizing operations with fast, accurate and transparent data in near real-time. To meet its goal, MES must conform to becoming a standard reusable application. To achieve an integrated flexible manufacturing environment at affordable costs it is evident that the work in the area has to be synchronized and data information must be well defined and organized. This research starts with a standard (National Institute of Standard and Technology, NIST) framework that defines a set of foundation modules for manufacturing execution with a set of interfacing data needed to properly define how MES fits in the overall architecture of plant information and functions. The information given to the MES by the authoring systems and status data from the plant floor systems is clearly defined to help illustrate the general role of the MES functions and interfacing data. By taking this framework the research properly applies the general application to a specific steel melt-shop plant case study. This is done to clarify the aim of the research in enabling the MES to feedback set points and control operations to the plant floor systems and provide scalability for growing the functionality of the MES. Both aims are accomplished by starting with the standard framework and adding specific intelligence to some of the modules in order to improve the MES control functionality.

The second functionality for improving the MES\u2019s near real-time plant floor control operations focused on the capability for handling disturbances.

This was derived from the MES functionality of having real-time plant floor status data.

The MES\u2019s capabilities in handling these disturbances were defined within the MES\u2019s framework through labeling the generic data presented in Chapter 2 to specific data found in Chapter 3. The specific data includes inputs, outputs and control to certain modules. The specific modules that use this data have built-in algorithms (mechanism data) designed to handle decoding the melt-shop\u2019s current status (Decode Decision Parameters Algorithm) and providing this information to the Production Unit Rescheduling Algorithm for re-optimizing the heats. This is an attempt to try and avoid turnaround if possible and provide a new resource allocation for the heats based on what is available, while still trying to optimize for lowest cost for transition steel produced during casting. The second aim for allowing scalability and improvements to the MES\u2019s abilities of providing feedback through control algorithms is supportable through the standard framework.

This will trigger the queue transitioning to its next state. Immediately following this the \u2018change_state\u2019 is reset back to zero, and the subsystem \u2018Signal_State\u2019 switches to the \u201cBUSY\u2019 state. During the transition, a broadcast local event \u2018EAF_Start_timer\u2019 is executed in order to start the timer subsystem \u2018EAF_Timer\u2019.o The \u2018BUSY\u2019 state represents the processing of the incoming heat by the chosen EAF. This state is active up until the \u2018EAF_Timer\u2019 broadcasts the local event \u2018LF_Start_Timer\u2019 to indicate that the EAF processing is done. Then the \u2018EAF\u2019 subsystem sends the heat grade information to the \u2018LF_Timer\u2019 subsystem by copying the grade value in the local variable \u2018Grade\u2019 to the variable \u2018LF_Grade\u2019, at which point the \u2018EAF\u2019 subsystem goes back to the \u2018IDLE\u2019 state for the next possible heat.

They are \u2018Caster\u2019 (as shown below), \u2018Turnaround_Timer\u2019 and \u2018Caster_Timer\u2019. These subsystems are shown in separate diagrams due to their complexity. The \u2018Caster\u2019 in the steel making process shown above has seven states.o \u2018IDLE\u2019 state means the Caster is idle. When any one of LFA, LFB or LFC are ready for casting, they broadcast the event, \u2018caster_requestA\u2019, \u2018caster_requestB\u2019or \u2018caster_requestC\u2019 respectively to the Caster. Because the \u2018Caster\u2019 subsystem has to enforce the sequence of heat processing, it does not always accept the heat that is ready first. Instead it always checks if the ready heat is the expected heat. The expected heat value is defined by local variable \u2018Request\u2019. When \u2018Caster\u2019 expects the first heat the",

The \u2018Caster\u2019 subsystem also checks which heat from LF (A, B or C) is ready for casting.\u2022 If \u2018Caster\u2019 decides to cast the heat from LF-A, it goes to \u2018Clear_RequestA\u2019 state.\u2022 If \u2018Caster\u2019 decides to cast the heat from LF-B, it goes to \u2018Clear_RequestB\u2019 state.\u2022 If \u2018Caster\u2019 decides to cast the heat from LF-C, it goes to \u2018Clear_RequestC\u2019 state.\u2022 If the heat in the LF is ready but that heat is not the one expected by the \u2018Caster\u2019, it goes back to \u2018IDLE\u2019 to wait for the right heat.

This event also causes the variable \u2018Request\u2019 to be incremented by 1, so the \u2018Caster\u2019 will expect the next heat after the received heat is cast.
